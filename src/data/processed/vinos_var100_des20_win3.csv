US,"Bold hits of spice, vanilla, toast and smoke envelop this Cabernet Franc, but beneath it all, there's a penetrating core of berry and cherry flavors that resonates.

US,"Ste. Michelle's Dry Riesling carries a special, gold-colored label, and the word ‘dry' is prominently displayed.

US,"The Chateau's reserve is not their best Chardonnay (that honor belongs to the Cold Creek) but it's their most accessible, made in a powerful, lush style with softer fruit and more obvious new oak.

US,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.",91,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2004,4.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste.

There's plenty of fruit flavor and concentration, but it's difficult to pair such a blockbuster with food.",89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,4.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste.

US,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Cold Creek vineyard. Smooth and fruit forward, it's done in a seamless, accessible, ready-to-drink style that makes it difficult to put down. A fair amount of vanilla flavor comes through, accenting a consumer (and consumption) friendly style.",88,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"This 100% varietal from one of the state's oldest vineyards brims with aromas of dark roasted coffee, char, bittersweet chocolate and black cherry. Flavors show plenty of concentration and depth with a lingering, cocoa and vanilla-filled finish.",91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Barrel-forward aromas of vanilla and toast are in front of herb and cherry. The palate brings a sense of polish and appeal, with the tannins bringing some squeeze on the finish.",90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from older vines, the Cold Creek bottling often begins life rather compact, even hard, and will usually benefit from some years of bottle age. This 2005 is a tough, somewhat stemmy wine, with tightly wound black fruits, herbs and leather wrapped into its core. Tannic and unyielding, even after some hours of breathing time, it is a bit too soon to know exactly how good it will ultimately become.",88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,4.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Aromas of black fruit, spiced plum, vanilla and herb lead to full dark fruit flavors. It shows a lot of ripeness but keeps it in balance.",90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors.",88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,17.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Aromas of cedar, vanilla, raspberry, coffee, herbs and barrel spice are followed by concentrated fruit flavors backed by firm tannins. It's a delicious example of the variety.",90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Baking spice and vanilla aromas are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and barrel spices. The barrel influence (71% new French and American) leads on the palate as well, with abundant vanilla flavors that wash over the fruit. There's some good fruit underneath, if you can get to it.",87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,17.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Reserve caliber fruit—a throat-coating mix of blueberry, cherry and cassis—rolls into a rich, full throttle wash of barrel flavors. Toast, smoke, espresso and dark chocolate give the wine depth and gravitas. Ageworthy to be sure, but also enjoyable right now.",91,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,17.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"This vineyard-designated Merlot includes 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. This vintage, Syrah is eliminated and alcohol is lowered—a welcome shift. Rich and loaded with black fruits, it carries interesting accents of caramel popcorn, yielding a delicious, tongue-coating wine with a silky-smooth mouthfeel. It has good length, and the possibility of aging for another five or six years.",90,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,17.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage this wine offers a blue-fruit profile seldom seen in the state for this variety along with notes of chocolate and coffee. It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish.",87,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2011,17.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Despite coming from the warmest vintage on record for the state, this wine displays a very pleasing sense of restraint. Aromas of straw, clarified butter and peach are followed by well-balanced, textured fruit flavors. An elegant styling only heightens the appeal.",90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2015,2.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",89,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,2.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Powerful scents of toast and buttered popcorn dominate the nose, but once in the mouth the wine shows some grip and depth. For those who love the buttery style of Chardonnay, this will be hard to beat at this price. Traces of apple and pear fruit show in the midpalate, and the wine lingers gracefully into a full-bodied finish.",89,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Smooth and spicy, matching bright, tight, sweet-tart lemony fruit to nicely integrated barrel notes of sandalwood and graham cracker. The sleek structure, balanced for cellaring as well as immediate enjoyment.",92,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,2.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The Cold Creek Chardonnay is built upon 30-year-old vines, fully ripened at this warm site. Sensuous, soft and broadly laced with flavors of toasted nuts, brioche and apple pie, this luxurious Chardonnay still maintains a pleasing, focused structure that carries along flavors of lemon and apple, cut against the dominant oak. Cold Creek wines are among Washington's most ageworthy.",90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,2.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance.",91,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,2.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,Barrel notes of toast and spice intermingle with stone fruit aromas and flavors that show nuance. The flavors are light but the feel is compelling.,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The blend includes 18% Syrah, which helps to emphasize the spice and sweet fruit flavors. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish.",85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,4.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Aromas of matchstick, herb, vanilla and cinnamon are followed by a creamy-feeling palate that equally mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins seem a bit bunched up.",87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"For a few dollars more than the regular CSM Cabernet, the Indian Wells delivers extra density and complexity. It holds firm, dark fruits and is slightly grainy, but well-ripened tannins carry the wine, and it's less dependent upon oak treatments and flavors of vanilla and cream. Persistent and substantial, it's offers good value, and often sells for less than the listed price.",89,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,4.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, dill and blue-black fruit are bright and focused. The plum and barrel flavors show depth and a sense of texture, with lingering flavors. This wine is not typically Cabernet but it offers much appeal.",90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"This should prove to be quite popular, as it's loaded with blackberry and sweet black cherry fruit flavors. It carries the fruit with stiff but polished tannins, and brings in accents of licorice, coffee and dark chocolate. Nothing is overdone; the balance here is just right, and the addition of 16% Syrah brings with it a dash of pepper.",87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,4.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It should definitely be decanted and aired out before serving, which will help to push the fruit flavors forward. The finish is just slightly dilute, but the wine is well-made and may just be suffering from some of the occasional dumbness that strikes Cabernet.",86,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,4.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The popular Indian Wells bottling from Chateau Ste. Michelle includes 10% Syrah, sourced from the Wahluke Slope. The combination is a proven winner. This medium-bodied, fruit-forward wine's inviting raspberry and cherry flavors are anchored with well-structured tannins.",89,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,4.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties. The coffee and berry aromas seem faint while the palate delivers all of the plush fruit flavors this vintage has to offer.",88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,3.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"A new addition to the popular Indian Wells line, this consists of 60% Merlot, 28% Syrah and splashes of five other grapes. The Merlot, not surprisingly, dominates. Pretty and round, it has a soft, almost pillowy texture, with an easy, accessible mouthfeel.",88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,3.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Forward and spicy, this puts some muscle into the Merlot with earthy, tongue-gripping tannins. The fruit has a sweet tomato flavor, with a streak of cherry candy. Though not entirely knit together, it's a pleasant drink best enjoyed young.",86,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,17.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"As with the Indian Wells Cabernet, winemaker Bob Bertheau is using a considerable amount of Syrah (19%) to beef up the flavors. The Merlot here seems a bit light, it fades out in midpalate. There is a chalkiness to the finish, and the tannins are just a little green.",85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,17.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, cocoa and milk chocolate out in front of blackberry and black cherry. The palate also mixes fruit and barrel, showing pleasing depth of flavors and intensity along with a silky texture.",90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2015,17.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, spice and red fruit, along with high-toned vanilla accents.

US,"An elegant wine, with nicely framed red berry fruit flavors. Hints of dried herbs and modest tannins put everything in balanced proportion.",88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,17.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Barrel aromas of vanilla, coconut and toast are at the fore followed by luxurious coffee and plum flavors that linger. Grainy tannins back it all up.",88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,17.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Smooth and oaky, with a soft and accessible appeal, this is a more limited production offering than the Chateau's regular Columbia Valley Chardonnay. Though undeniably charming, it thins out quickly and does not have the vivid complexity of its sibling.",86,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Barrel spice, pineapple, butterscotch and candlewax aromas are followed by full-bodied tropical-fruit flavors. It displays a lot of richness but retains its sense of balance.",90,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The 2011 vintage is a high-water mark for the Indian Wells Chardonnay, principally because the oaky, buttered popcorn flavors have been muted. It's a firm, slightly tart mix of green and yellow fruits, with supporting acids and excellent length. Pleasantly toasty, but not over the top.",90,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Always a wine that shows a powerful oak influence, this new Indian Wells seems soaked in buttered popcorn flavor. The finish comes out a little bitter, with little fruit flavor to round it out.",85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Though it's had some extra time in the bottle, the oaky edges of this wine still seem a little rough and tumble. Or maybe it's the banana cream pie flavors—appealing in their way, but opposite end of the spectrum from, say, the minerality of a Chablis. Front loaded, creamy and rich, this has generous amounts of the oak and toast that many consumers crave.",88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Consistent with previous bottlings, this is dark, oaky, lush with scents and flavors of butter, toast and roasted nuts. The fruit seems secondary to the parade of butterscotch, brown sugar and spice that comes walloping through the palate. The wine turns slightly bitter in the finish. This is a wine for those who love the California style of Chardonnay.",87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of butterscotch, peach and toasty spices. It's lighter in style with a creamy feel to the stone and tropical fruit flavors.",88,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The Indian Wells Chardonnay by this producer continues to improve with each vintage. Here, the melding of luscious tropical fruit with buttery barrel flavors is just about perfect. Pineapple, Meyer lemon and candied oranges highlight the intense flavors, and the lushly-applied oak influences carry the full-bodied wine to hold a smooth, satisfying finish.",91,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,2.0,Indian Wells,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Part of a Limited Release series, this is an all-stainless Chardonnay. Ripe, tart and focused, it offers spicy bursts of yellow and green fruits, and it shows a sur lie-derived texture. The pinpoint details are gorgeous.",91,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,2.0,Unoaked,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"Almost lacy in its delicacy, There's a crisp, underripe stone fruit and lime skin tone that reverberates through this refreshing, dry Riesling.

US,"Smoky flint and crushed mineral tones contrast concentrated raspberry and strawberry flavors in this richly concentrated rosé.

Sunny acidity brightens the finish.",88,17.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2015,9.0,Dry,Lamoreaux Landing
US,"While bright and tropical on the nose, the intense ripeness of this dry Cabernet Franc rosé lends a caramelized, almost ruddy richness to the palate. Brisk acidity lends balance and structure.",86,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2014,9.0,Dry,Lamoreaux Landing

Iijima,2010,17.0,Estate Bottled,Lamoreaux Landing
US,"Lamoreaux's standard-label Cabernet Franc spends 18 months in American oak, adopting layers of sweet spice, vanilla and smoke that penetrate deeply into its black cherry core. It's taut and unyielding on the palate, with bold acidity and big, brawny tannins, but should meld beautifully with 3–5 years in the cellar.",89,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C.

US,"The goal here, says the winery, is to craft a wine that embodies the essence of Pinot Noir. Whatever that means, this is their priciest Pinot and the one that they have designated Reserve. It's got bulk and power, and I like the way it gathers strength in the mid-palate and on through the finish. It has pretty cherry fruit and good concentration; it does not have the textural detail of the single vineyard Corral Creek.",90,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,1.0,Reserve,Chehalem
US,"This is a forward, even plush Reserve, loaded with generous black fruits and streaked with anise and cola notes.

Richly textured, yet neatly balanced, it's drinking beautifully now but should hold well over the next decade.",91,41.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2012,17.0,Reserve,Damiani
US,"A whiff of roasted nuts adds a rustic character to ripe black fruit on this Merlot.

US,"Brisk and lean with a crisp red currant and plum profile, this dry, medium-bodied Cab is pleasantly structured with sturdy tannins and a fresh, herbal midpalate. A bit lacking in intensity and depth, and the finish fades out quickly, but on a sweet vanilla-kissed note.",85,34.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2008,4.0,Barrel Select,Damiani
US,"This wine has the kind of beefy, muscular character that one expects in a Cab, with its earthy berry and leathery spice nose, and a layering of tobacco smoke, black pepper and rich berry on the palate. Decent tannins and minerality add to the weight. A good wine with ageable appeal.",86,35.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Susan Kostrzewa,2006,4.0,Barrel Select,Damiani
US,"Ample toast, cinnamon and cedar gild this intensely ripe concentrated Cabernet Franc. It's a lusciously textured wine, full of fleshy blackberry and plum flavors. Velvety tannins, brisk red-currant acidity and meandering traces of smoked meat and game contribute finesse and depth. It's ready to drink now but should improve further through 2023.",91,43.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2013,19.0,Barrel Select,Damiani

US,"Assertively grassy, this pungent Sauvignon Blanc also carries a fairly strong diesel scent. Call it Pouilly-Fumé in style, though as a New World wine, it has more fruit, without the bracing minerality. The finish is clean and medium in length.",87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,12.0,Estate,Cave B

US,"Aged in neutral oak and blended with 15% Cabernet Franc, this is a high-toned wine with sharp, vinegary acids, but not much character. Tannins are chewy and mask the fruit.",82,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,10.0,Estate,Cave B
US,"Wet leaf, black cherry, and assertive barrel flavors of brown sugar, maple syrup and crème brûlée are the dominant notes in this blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc. The short, slightly bitter, green finish is the downside.",85,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,10.0,Estate,Cave B
US,"Neutral oak, 100% varietal. These three new releases from Cave B all taste of extremely young fruit, perhaps overcropped? In any event, without much going on.

US,"Aromas of barrel spice are up front on this locked-up wine, followed by pencil lead, herb, vanilla, black currant and cherry. The palate brings a compelling sense of texture, juxtaposed by aggressive tannins that need a significant amount of time to come into their own.

Sullivan,2012,4.0,Seven Hills Vineyard,Seven Hills
US,"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition.

US,"If a whiff of volatility doesn't turn you off, this tightly layered reserve from Hogue has a lot going for it. Gobs of cherry and cassis fruit, dense and deep, roll into veins of earth, olive and graphite. A big wine with plenty of life ahead.",91,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2007,4.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"Good juice anchors this Cabernet blend, with the 13% Malbec and 10% Merlot filling in the flavors. Cassis and pomegranate notes hit first, followed by darker notes of cacao and coffee, dotted with black pepper.",90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,4.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"The aromas on this wine lean into the green, with notes of herbs, cedar and woodspice that seem somewhat at odds with the variety. The supple flavors show a mixture of intensity and restraint.",87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of blackberry bramble and fruit leather. The flavors also seem considerably more evolved than its age. It's a big miss.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,17.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"High-toned and already considerably far down the aging path, this 98% pure Merlot (2% Cabernet Sauvignon) brings the heat (14.9% alcohol) and packs substantial, earthy tannins. The fruit flavors remain on the lighter side of strawberry and raspberry, with a strong herbal component running through the middle and into the finish.",86,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2005,17.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"At first a stiff, unyielding wine, this shows promising—though compact—dark fruits with a strong herbal streak. Fresh greens and other herbs move into a finish with barrel flavors of tar and espresso.",88,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,17.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"The best Hogue Chardonnay in years, this 2007 reserve bottling showcases fully ripened apple, peach and melon fruit flavors in a luscious wrapping of new oak. Butterscotch and a whisp of vanilla carry through the seductive finish.",90,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2007,2.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"Perhaps an unrepresentative bottle (just one was submitted), but this 2008 reserve was muddy in the glass and flabby in the mouth. Oaky and buttery to an extreme degree, it had lost all freshness and fruit.",83,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"The aromas are almost completely shut down, with light notes of corn on the cob and peach. The flavors are lightly concentrated, making it a strain to hear what they have to say.",85,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,Reserve,Hogue
US,"Just 183 cases were made of this wine, which has firm stone fruits and a more-than-generous amount of toast and butter. If you like your Chardonnays on the extra oaky side, this is for you.",86,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2009,2.0,Reserve,Hogue

US,"Quite savory in style, this dry full-bodied Riesling suggests pressed apple and pear flavors marked by brisk slightly puckering acidity. A touch of sweet spice warms a moderately long finish.",86,25.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2013,7.0,Estate,Jamesport

US,"A warm amber color and intense, concentrated honey and toasted-nut aromas are followed by a supple, soft texture and mouthcoating flavors of sweet apricot and baked peaches. This will be fantastic as a dessert in itself, or with some less-sweet cookies or sautéed almonds.",93,36.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Jim Gordon,2013,7.0,Late Harvest,Greenwood Ridge
US,"This has a rather deep red color and a slightly smoky rim. It offers profuse aromas of black cherry and blackberry, medium to full body and a generous texture.

The finish is lingering and almost sweet.",87,30.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Jim Gordon,2013,1.0,Estate Bottled,Greenwood Ridge
US,"This Pinot offers bright tart cherry fruit and earthy spice in good proportion and is softly textured.

US,"With residual sugar at 200 g/L, this is much more concentrated than the average wine labeled Late Harvest.

Deep peach and apricot flavors and a hint of caramel linger through a satisfying finish.",89,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,7.0,Late Harvest,Airfield Estates
US,"High-toned aromas of cocoa, barrel spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead to plentiful, focused fruit and barrel flavors. The flavors linger on the finish.",90,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Reserve,Airfield Estates
US,"Though labeled reserve, this is barely distinguishable from the winery's regular Cabernet. More toast, and a little chocolate is showing, but the fruit flavors—pale blackberry and black currant—are quickly covered up by the aggressive tannins.",85,32.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,4.0,Reserve,Airfield Estates

Still young and compact, it shows succulent green apple and white peach flavors along with toast and butterscotch.",88,20.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Reserve,Airfield Estates
US,"Sourced from the winery's highest, steepest site, and barrel-fermented with partial malolactic, this is a fine effort in a lighter vintage. Yeasty and creamy in the mouth, it melds a mix of banana, pineapple and coconut cream in a wine with excellent structure and length. The hint of caramel provides a flourish on the finish.",89,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,2.0,Reserve,Airfield Estates
US,"This young, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay has a beery hoppiness to the aromas, leading into a tart, juicy and crisp palate of lime and grapefruit. The acids taste of wet stone, and that vivid minerality brings dimension and lift to the finish.",88,13.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,2.0,Unoaked,Airfield Estates
US,"A light mix of apple, jicama and pear fruit, bolstered with plenty of acidity, carries this medium-weight, unoaked Chardonnay. It's perfectly pleasant, but teeters on the edge of generic flavor neutrality.",86,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,2.0,Unoaked,Airfield Estates

US,"Spicy-sweet notes of dried orange peel and mango waft from this aromatic late-harvest wine. Lip-smacking marmalade sweetness is countered by a piercing strike of lemon acidity. Juicy and quaffable, it would be a lovely accompaniment to spicy Asian cuisine or a cheese plate.",87,34.0,New York,Hudson River Region,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2014,7.0,Late Harvest,Millbrook
US,"Generous streaks of caramel and honey seem to glaze this delectably sweet late-harvest Riesling.

Iijima,2013,7.0,Late Harvest,Millbrook

US,"Millbrook's unoaked Chardonnay shares much of the luscious tropical fruit and fleshy mouthfeel of the oaked bottling, but without the embellishment of oak maturation. It's still quite a creamy, indulgent sip with a lingering lactic finish.",89,18.0,New York,Hudson River Region,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2016,2.0,Unoaked,Millbrook
US,"As with Kiona's off-dry Washington Riesling, this includes a bit of Gewürztraminer, a clever addition that brings some spiciness into play. Intensely aromatic, the wine is almost Muscat-like, with dense orange peel flavors, along with citrus, tea and madeleine cookie. This is a sensational value from a leading Riesling producer.",92,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,7.0,Late Harvest,Kiona

US,"This is 100% Cabernet from a 25-year-old estate vineyard. There’s plenty of vanilla and cassis in the nose, with some pickled volatile acidity lurking about. Firm and earthy, with a hint of mint and some dark, toasty streaks running through the red fruit. High-toned and slightly hot in the finish.",87,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,1997,4.0,Reserve,Kiona
US,"Principally sourced from the winery's oldest block of Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers a solid core of dense black cherry and cassis fruit.

US,"The aromas seem slightly dried out, with notes of dried black raspberry, cigar box, herb, fruit leather, vanilla and barrel spice. The flavors are lightly jammy but at the same time the concentration doesn't all seem to be there. The tannins give a gentle squeeze.",88,25.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,17.0,Estate Bottled,Kiona
US,"The point of this semisweet bottling is a little unclear, but it offers a beautifully rich nose of honeysuckle, buttercream, white peach, almond paste and flint.

Consider it as a light dessert wine or a pairing for spicy foods.",88,36.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2015,2.0,Late Harvest,Boekenoogen
US,"A damp herbal character shows first on the nose of this wine, with wet sage and marjoram spicing up the stewed cranberry fruit. The action explodes once sipped, with black cherry and mulberry giving backbone to the cardamom and other Indian-spice components. It combines richness and energy.",93,56.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2013,1.0,Estate,Boekenoogen
US,"Blending distinction with sheer pleasure, the bouquet opens with scents of green, black, and Kalamata olives, sage, forest floor and slate.

US,"Delicious aromas of dark raspberries, Bing cherries, black pepper, pipe smoke, smoked meats, thyme and just enough dank mushroom greet the nose. This wine is very full on the ripe and juicy palate, showing more raspberry, rhubarb, dried strawberry and warm black licorice, all balanced by plum-skin bitterness and just enough tannic structure.",94,39.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2012,1.0,Estate,Boekenoogen
US,"This family-run vineyard and winery continues to excite, delivering delicious, broadly appealing aromas of caramelized yellow pears with a cinnamon-butter glaze, honey-laced pineapple and lemon soda.

On the palate, some creaminess emerges alongside flavors of tart green apple and toffee nuts. Serve with lemon-herb chicken or well-seasoned fish dishes.",91,38.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2011,2.0,Estate,Boekenoogen
US,"Aromas of golden honey and concentrated white flowers entertain the nose on this dessert offering from the urban winery on Santa Barbara's Eastside. Quite delicious and balanced once sipped, the viscous flavors blend honey, lemonade reduction and guava, with bright acidity keeping it nicely alive on the palate.",90,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Matt Kettmann,2012,25.0,Late Harvest,Jaffurs
US,"Bien Nacido Vineyard actually planted this grape decades ago at Craig Jaffurs' request, and his mastery shows, with aromas balancing between sharper lime zest and riper white peach. There's lots of verve on the palate, yet the steely acidity is presented with medium brushstrokes rather than jabs, with flavors of poached pears, lime glaze and nectarine.",89,27.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Matt Kettmann,2013,25.0,Bien Nacido Vineyard,Jaffurs

US,"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out.

US,"Still young and not entirely pulled together, this is still showing some post-fermentation flavors of candied orange, with a somewhat grainy texture. It's off-dry, with the 3% residual sugar quite apparent.",87,16.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2010,7.0,Estate,David Hill
US,"The winery notes that these are the oldest commercial Riesling vines in Oregon, planted in 1965. This has a succulent core of sweet apple-flavored fruit, quite rich and delicious. It dries out a little toward the back, but continues with excellent length and more of that crystal clear fresh red apple flavor.

US,"A gorgeous, rich and aromatic Riesling, this is a tribute to the expressive dimensions that old vines can provide (these were planted in 1965).

US,"Made from vines planted in 1965, David Hill's estate Riesling is aromatic and textural, with an interesting, nuanced character that brings apples, peaches, pears and passion fruit flavors in profusion.

US,"Though low in alcohol even by David Hill standards, this excellent Pinot Gris does not lack fruit or flavor. Ripe and tasting of pretty pear and orange fruit, it shows evidence of some well-balanced residual sugar. Vivid acidity cuts through to a satisfying finish.",91,17.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,18.0,Estate,David Hill

Vivid acidity cuts through the fleshy core.",91,15.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2009,18.0,Estate,David Hill

US,"This is finished dry, at 13.3% alcohol, and puts the emphasis on citrus and grass, cracker and grain. There is a smidgeon of varietal perfume—a whiff of rose petal—but overall it's trending more toward Sauvignon Blanc than most Gewürztraminer. Nonetheless there is an impression of sweetness on the palate, from the nicely-ripened fruit.",88,15.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,23.0,Estate,David Hill
US,"Though 28 g/L of residual sugar is indicated, this lushly fruity and thoroughly delicious wine does not seem at all sweet, and just barely off dry.

US,"There's a delicate lemon scent, leading into a mix of citrus, grapefruit peel and honeysuckle. The wine gains weight in the mouth, showing ripe fruit (yellow apples) and a soft, lightly oxidized finish with toasted coconut and cracker. Quite delicious, distinctive and rich.",90,15.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,38.0,Estate,David Hill
US,"From the producer's original, own-rooted 1965 plantings, this light, dry and lovely wine offers citrus and apple skin flavors, along with hints of leafy greens. The fruit skin flavors persist through its lingering finish.",89,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2016,38.0,Estate,David Hill
US,"This cool-climate wine offers relatively low alcohol and a delicate, mineral-driven structure. A light floral note opens into a complex, invigorating palate, mixing honeysuckle, beeswax, apple and wet stone. It comes from original, own-rooted, 1965 plantings according to the winery.",91,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,38.0,Estate,David Hill
US,"From dry-farmed, own-rooted vines planted in 1965 by Charles Coury, this selection is remarkably fresh and forward. Lush strawberry and black cherry flavors comingle, with chocolaty tannins and exceptional texture, detail and length. It spent 14 months in 30% new French oak. Beginning with the 2015 vintage, it will have national distribution.",92,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Old Vine,David Hill
US,"This small production (200 cases) Pinot Noir is a mix of older and younger estate vines, a selection of lots given 22 months in 60 and 132 gallon French oak casks. It's still tasting quite young, sharp and chewy, with spicy fruit backed up against earthy tannins. Give it plenty of breathing time.",87,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,1.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"Edgy and herbal, the 2010 Reserve mixes cranberry fruit with Mediterranean herbs. There's a suggestion of black olives also, and the tangy tartness adds lift to the mouthfeel.",88,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2010,1.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"Bright fruit flavors of mountain berries are bolstered with steely acidity. This firm, lightly herbal wine sneaks in a hint of clover as well. It may improve with another couple of years of bottle age.",89,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"This is the most intractable of the winery's 2008 Pinot Noirs, holding back in the glass and showing plenty of grip and tannin. Tight and compact, with a distinctive black pepper scent, this wine needs more bottle age. With time, the score could certainly improve.",89,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,1.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"A light touch works well with this elegant reserve. Its wild berry flavor and juicy acids are seemless, with a kiss of oak carried through on the finish.",88,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2009,1.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.",85,18.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,2.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"Soft and buttery, this drink-now style is as smooth as a polished stone. The fruit is fairly generic and light, but the penetrating punch of popcorn and nut oil carries it along nicely.",88,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,2.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"This is buttery to a fault, with the overpowering aroma of microwave popcorn. Once in the mouth, the simple fruit flavors are buried, and the finish leaves a lightly bitter impression.",85,18.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"There is an interesting floral component—white blossoms—coming through in the nose, and sailing along on top of flavors of buttered nuts. A somewhat oily mouthfeel is lifted by moderate acids, and the overall length and follow-through make this one of the better vintages of this affordably priced wine.",90,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,2.0,Estate Reserve,David Hill
US,"A leesy, textural, racy and refreshing Riesling, this is loaded with lime, grapefruit and melon flavors. There is a streak of gin-like botanicals as well, and a rich, resonant finish.",92,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,7.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"Aged in 46% new American, 40% new French oak, this is predictably tannic and oaky, though smooth and showing generous fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry. It's a steak wine all the way, with some chalkiness to the tannins, though nothing that a juicy cut of beef cannot power through.",89,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"Consistent with the rather lean house style this opens with herbal aromas set against firm, varietal cassis and blue plum fruit. The grapes come from a block planted in 1985. Some barrel spice adds cinnamon to the nose, and there's a touch of Cab Franc (6%) in the blend, which stiffens up the tannins. Retasting this wine after it has spent a few extra months in bottle, it's smoothed out a bit, and the sweet black- cherry fruit has moved forward. This should age really well.",89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2004,4.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"Tight black fruit and hints of stem and wood suggest that this herbal Cabernet needs more time in bottle. The tannins are slightly green, and the softening influence of buttery barrel aging has not yet been fully integrated.",87,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,4.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"The mix of fruits here is unusual, with flavors of citrus, stone fruit and berry all in play. A pure Malbec, with lots of acid and a tightly wound middle, it should smooth out a bit with more time in bottle.",87,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,8.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"Broadly flavorful when first sipped, this turns aggressively oaky in the mouth. The liquorous barrel flavors will please some tasters, while others will wonder where the fruit went?",87,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,17.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"Hard and tannic at first, this young wine grudgingly reveals a core of very tart cherry fruit, encased in flavors of stem and wood. A coffee-infused finish does not conceal the chewy, tough tannins.",86,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,17.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"Consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes has imprinted his benchmark style on Gamache fruit. This is a big, ripe, blocky but powerful wine—all Merlot as only Washington State can grow it. The ripe cassis fruit is enveloped in a mix of French and American oak, half new, yielding strong flavors of smoke, tobacco and mocha. A blockbuster style, ready to drink right now.",91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,17.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"This feels a bit stripped, though the bottle says the alcohol hits almost 15%. There is a chocolaty coating over sharp, herbal, rather thin fruit flavors. The wine shows pleasant strawberry and watermelon fruit flavors, though the tannins and chocolaty barrel flavors quickly take over.",86,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,17.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check.",91,27.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,19.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"Made from vines nearly 30 years old, this ultra-ripe Sauvignon Blanc was oak-aged in neutral barrels, and comes across with Chardonnay-like richness. It's viscous, rich to the point of liquorous—not for all palates, but done well in its way.",89,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,12.0,Estate,Gamache
US,"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",93,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,Reserve,Gamache
US,"Pear, almond and toast aromas lead to dry, elegant fruit and lees flavors. It's a uniquely styled offering of the variety.",86,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,7.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"Aromas of purple fruit, cocoa, green-pepper, vanilla and cherry bring easy-drinking pepper and cherry flavors. The concentration seems surprisingly light and the fruit a bit green given the quality of the vintage.",86,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"Aromas of blue and purple fruit mix with notes of dried thyme and black pepper. The flavors are tart and elegant, showing a good sense of balance and restraint, with a finish that lingers.",89,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2011,8.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"This aromatically unusual wine, with notes of cocoa and green herb, seems to show some oxidation. The purple fruit and orange-peel flavors are on the lighter side of medium bodied, pulling up on the finish.",86,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,8.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"Already five years old, this wine still doesn't hasn't opened up, seeming fairly muted aromatically. The flavors are medium bodied, round in the middle and tapering toward the finish.",88,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"Aromas of herb, macerated cherries, toast, flowers and a strong Band Aid note are followed by sleek cherry and game flavors that narrowtoward the finish.",86,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,19.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"Barrel aromas are in the lead here, with notes of sawdust and cedar, along with Band Aid and gamy notes. Dark fruit aromas are in the background. The full-bodied flavors reveal more of the same, showing a lot of heat.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,6.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"Cranberry, blueberry, vanilla and milk chocolate aromas are at the fore. It's silky in feel with a reserved styling.",88,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2011,6.0,Estate Grown,Gamache
US,"From the only Riesling vines planted in the Walla Walla AVA, this Figgins wine club-only selection makes you wish for more. It has lovely layering of citrus pith and rind flavors, a mouth-cleansing minerality, and exceptional depth of flavor. Finished completely dry, it registers just 12% alcohol.",90,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2013,7.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"Sold through the wine club. Excellent concentration in this ripe, full-bodied Riesling. It delivers a boat-load of fruit flavors, explosive aromatics and marvelous length. Citrus, peach and pear fruit is underscored with delicate minerality. Juicy, sappy and long.",92,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,7.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"This is one of the only Rieslings to come out of the valley. The aromas are reserved for the variety, with notes of lime leaf, citrus, Bosc pear and nut oil. The palate drinks dry, and is flavorful, with abundant stone-fruit and citrus notes that linger. It seems a bit heavy handed but still brings enjoyment.",89,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2016,7.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"Closed-up at present, this aromatic brooder has notes of red and black fruit, scorched earth and herbs, along with a floral top note. It has a mountain-fruit profile of firm, chewy tannins, tart acids and dense flavors. Time in the cellar is required to fully appreciate it. Let it be until at least 2020 but it should have a good 15 years beyond that.",94,85.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,5.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"Sourced entirely from the estate vineyard, this is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Merlot, with just a splash of Petit Verdot. Fat, juicy, toasty and deliciously flavorful, it opens quickly into a plush midpalate, with pomegranate and raspberry fruit dominant. Streaks of caramel and nougat thread through the generous finish. Enjoy right now.",94,85.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,5.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot all coming from a single vineyard site. It's wound up tightly at present, with aromas of herb, dark fruit, spice and earth. The palate is big and bold, with rich fruit flavors and a firm lick of tannins. Best from 2024–2030.",93,85.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,5.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"This is the third release of Figgins, a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins from his Figgins Estate vineyard. Intensely aromatic, it explodes from the glass with baking spices and deep cassis fruit. Over the course of three days it opened into a sleek, stylish, complex mix of purple- and black-berries, dried herbs, bark, dusty cocoa and a streak of caramel. Long and lush, it's a wine to cellar for a decade or more.",96,85.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,5.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"This blend offers beguiling, complex aromas of violets, scorched earth, cassis, black licorice and graphite. The flavors are tightly wound, showing poise and presence. It drinks well out of the gate but cellaring will be particularly rewarded. Best from 2022 through 2030.",93,85.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,5.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"The second release of Figgins—a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins—is astonishing. Tasted in a lineup of exceptional Walla Walla reds, it outshined them all. It's a sophisticated blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, from the Figgins Vineyard, with gorgeous aromas of flowers, spices and black fruits. Seamless and long, complex and forceful without being overpowering, it can stand alongside top tier Bordeaux costing four or five times as much.",98,85.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,5.0,Estate,Figgins
US,"From old vines that offer more texture, steely minerality and nuance than young vines can deliver. You might find less fullness to the fruit, but this more than compensates with its robust depth. Lemon polish, Key lime, a bit of grapefruit and much more.",91,19.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2009,7.0,Estate,Elk Cove
US,"Bone dry, this succulent, citrus-soaked Riesling is a textural marvel. Mixing grapefruit, lime and pear fruit flavors, its racy acidity underscores its complexity.",91,19.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,7.0,Estate,Elk Cove
US,"Most of the estate vines used for this blend date back to the mid-1970s. It emphasizes bright citrus flavors, like lemon and lime, with lemon verbena, cilantro and other fresh herb notes that add detail to the finish. A very fine value, it can also age for a decade or longer.",92,19.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2016,7.0,Estate,Elk Cove
US,"This is a barrel selection, and as such, may be expected to show extra layers of concentration—more stuffing overall. It's a rich, smoky, lush wine, with a complex mix of red fruits ranging from rhubarb to raspberry to Bing cherries. Spicy highlights and a frame of orange peel also enter the picture. You might wish to give this another couple of years of bottle age before popping the cork. Drink 2018–2025.",92,100.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Reserve,Elk Cove
US,"Sourced from select barrels drawn from five estate vineyards, the reserve spent 10 months in oak. It is only made in exceptional years, and 2012 was certainly among the best in memory. Berry, cherry and toast components are here in full measure, with a sumptuous mocha-infused finish. Still young, this wine will show best with aeration, or tuck it away for some extra bottle age.",94,100.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Reserve,Elk Cove
US,"This marvelous vineyard has not been featured by Elk Cove previously. The characteristic blackberry fruit shines through, but winemaker Adam Campbell has wrapped it in the sort of elegant, lightly herbal, spicy flavors that define the Elk Cove style. Perfectly ripened at 14.5% alcohol, this wine manages to be both fruity and complex, open and layered.",91,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Elk Cove
US,"Crafted entirely from estate-grown fruit, this tart, citrus-flavored rosé is anchored in rhubarb and strawberry flavors. It offers medium concentration and length, with a subtle suggestion of cola woven into the finish.",88,16.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,1.0,Rosé,Elk Cove
US,"A lot of shale in the soils adds interest to this elegant, light, fairly soft wine. Off-dry and balanced, it represents good value. Flavors of apples, pears and blossoms lead; a soft finish with a hint of caramel wraps it up.",87,8.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,2001,7.0,Estate,Girardet
US,"Chocolate and plum mingle enticingly in this medium-bodied offering from the warm (relative to Willamette) Umpqua Valley. Subtle herb notes and a peppery, crisp finish keep this wine interesting from start to finish.",88,35.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Joe Czerwinski,1998,1.0,Reserve,Girardet
US,"Ripe, premium fruit and fairly high alcohol levels define this wine. A hot year and ripe fruit combine to create complexity in the nose, with an interesting mix of spices (cardamom, clove), lots of tannin, some darker fruit, and hints of smoke and earth. The only down side: it lacks weight and it finishes very tannic.",88,35.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,1999,1.0,Reserve,Girardet
US,"Off-dry, this succulent wine has you smacking your lips rather than puckering them. The natural acidity buoys up the sweet fruit, a mix of peach and apricot principally, and the wine has an excellent focused core that trails off into suggestions of honeycomb and lemon custard.",90,18.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,7.0,Estate Grown,Girardet
US,"Lovely aromatics shine in this low-alcohol, dry Riesling. Tangerine, lemon, apple and a hint of honey are in play. It's light, fresh and quite tart, yet the flavors show good concentration and length. Orange flesh and peel are in the forefront, with streaks of Meyer lemon and pineapple.",88,15.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,7.0,Estate Grown,Girardet

US,"Light red fruits with a suggestion of mint carry notes of leather, cedar and smoke. The blend includes 10% Merlot, and the wine spent 24 months in French oak, 15% new. Complex and balanced, with a streak of black olive, it's not a big wine, but well made and ready to drink.",88,38.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,4.0,Estate Grown,Girardet
US,"Clear, well-defined varietal scents of pepper, licorice and boysenberry cut through, with a hint of fresh-cut tobacco. A substrate of granite underscores this ripe, supple, medium-long wine with good grip and a polished mouthfeel. Drink 2015 through 2020.",89,38.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,6.0,Estate Grown,Girardet
US,"With this wine that comes from the cool 2010 vintage, you have to strain to hear the notes of cranberry, herbs and orange peel. The style is light, almost faint though remaining well executed.",86,28.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2010,1.0,Barrel Select,Girardet
US,"Rather sharp and dominated by piquant cranberry and field aromas. Light in color, with lean red-fruit flavors. A little green and heavily oaked—the dill and pickle from the wood show boldly. Has some good characteristics, but they’re just too hard to get at. From the hotter reaches of southern Oregon.",82,16.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Michael Schachner,1998,1.0,Barrel Select,Girardet
US,"Quite dry and flinty, this medium-bodied wine mixes citrus flesh and floral qualities with persistence and texture. Chill it just below cellar temperature, and it will liven up a variety of mellow cheeses and poultry dishes.",89,25.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Paul Gregutt,2016,7.0,Estate,Bryn Mawr Vineyards
US,"A lovely plum shade, this blends scents and flavors of pomegranate, cherry cola, Asian spice, black licorice and a dash of cacao. It's dense and penetrating, yet drinking well already. It spent nine months in 40% new French oak.",91,35.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Estate,Bryn Mawr Vineyards
US,"Barrel-fermented in half new, half neutral oak, this tasty wine offers crisp highlights of lemon and orange peel, along with substantial apple, kiwi and pear flavors. An appealing touch of crème brûlée comes out as it makes its graceful exit.",90,30.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Paul Gregutt,2015,2.0,Estate,Bryn Mawr Vineyards
US,"Combine the two block selections and you come close to this reserve. There's good intensity to the black-cherry fruit, and a base of minerality that gives it a mouthfeel as if it had been carved directly out of rock. Tight and ageworthy. Drink 2018 to 2026.",92,60.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Reserve,Bryn Mawr Vineyards

France,"Slight smoke mixes in the nose of this wine, with lifted mandarin-peel notes. The dry palate is streamlined and has uncommon lightness. It's weightless but concentrated, with full and bright citrus lift and a lively core brimming with lemon, bergamot and lime. The finish is wonderfully clean. This will drink well through 2024, at least.",93,40.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2012,7.0,Estate,Hugel

France,"A lovely, clean and aromatic lift of ripe red cherries is instantly appetizing. The palate is full of juicy fruit but structured with slightly rustic but smoothed-out tannins and a bright lively freshness. This is honest fresh-faced fruit-driven Pinot Noir without any pretentiousness that is a joy to drink.",90,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2013,1.0,Classic,Hugel
France,"Hints of rosewater and Turkish Delight waft from the glass. More toned down, the palate shines with citric freshness. There is quite a bit of warmth that seems to intensify the floral peach notes even more. It's very aromatic and varietally true, with a tropical finish of passion fruit.",90,28.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2014,23.0,Classic,Hugel

US,"This estate-grown Pinot Noir artfully blends seven different clones, capturing the nuances of each, and melding them into a fascinating wine. Dig in—you'll find plenty of black cherry and cassis fruit, streaked with iron, espresso and licorice. The texture and length add more subtlety, with a delicate hint of sandalwood at the very end.",91,45.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Estate,Carabella

US,"This is the first reserve Pinot Gris from the winery—half fermented in stainless, half in barrel. The wine feels as if it's very lightly oxidized, with dusty, tawny apple flavors that recall a good hard cider. Its power is in the persistent, bone dry finish, that never quits. Drink now through 2018.",91,26.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Paul Gregutt,2014,18.0,Reserve,Carabella

US,"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.",84,38.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Estate Grown,Belden Barns
US,"This producer shows its aptitude for whites with this dry, estate-grown effort, a bit cloudy thanks to the lack of fining and filtering. A touch of grass is on the nose, but then it's all rich, vanilla-laden texture and pear, the body medium and the wine lengthy and in balance.",90,26.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Virginie Boone,2014,12.0,Estate Grown,Belden Barns
US,"Fermented and aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine opens with a heady aroma of lemon cookie covered in powdered sugar, as a spicier element of lemongrass rears its head.

Drink this wine while cellaring the bigger wines from riper years.",88,45.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Paul Gregutt,2013,1.0,Estate,Raptor Ridge
US,"A bit of a disappointment, given the excellence of the winery's 2010 vineyard designates.

Decant for sure.",89,45.0,California,Edna Valley,Matt Kettmann,2011,1.0,Estate,Center of Effort
US,"More like an off white in color than actually pink, this 100% barrel-fermented, free-drained wine shows lemon blossoms, Pink Lady apple and lime zest on a very restrained nose.

US,"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir.

US,"The deep black color of this wine suggests that it spent a lot of time on the skins, and 20 months in American oak added further grip and grit to the tannins. Cherry tobacco, espresso and plenty of oak flavors lead into a chewy finish with some residual bitterness.",86,45.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,4.0,Reserve,Weisinger
US,"A bright copper color, this is done in a French style, with an emphasis less on freshness than on more mature flavors. Impressions of rose water, cracker and orange liqueur contribute to the mix.

US,"Pink-orange in color, this is a tangy, high-acid wine that's not for everyone, given its bracing mix of tangerine and grapefruit. Light-bodied, yet textured, it's a good quaffer and food-friendly companion.",88,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2015,1.0,Rosé of,Merriam
US,"Styring releases their wines with plenty of bottle age and doesn't shy from high alcohol. The level of ripeness in this bottling is not for everyone, veering more toward Zin-like power than Pinot Noir elegance. It's lushly aromatic, with dominant pine needle and raspberry extract flavors. A dense, concentrated and pungent wine with a spicy top note.",92,45.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Paul Gregutt,2013,1.0,Estate,Styring

This is a light vintage, but beautifully rendered here, with sweet cherry fruit, bracing acidity and a lively mouthfeel that invites further sipping. The underlying minerality carries a hint of toasted cracker.",91,60.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Paul Gregutt,2007,1.0,Estate,Winderlea
US,"Scented with herbs, pine needles and a hint of pepper, this has a solid core of tart, wild-cherry fruit. The tannins are drying and show some stem flavors, but as the wine breathes it smoothes out and softens up.",90,48.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Winderlea

US,"Toast, lightly roasted Marcona almonds, a touch of hazelnut and hints of melon and lemon blossom converge on the nose of this delicious and cleanly made wine.

It would pair with everything from lighter fish dishes to smoked chicken.",93,38.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2014,2.0,Estate,McIntyre Vineyards
US,"Broad across the palate, the new vintage of Redhawk's estate bottling opens with mixed berry and watermelon flavors, and thins out quickly. The fruit is outweighed by the alcohol, which is strong enough to burn a bit in the finish.",86,22.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Paul Gregutt,2009,1.0,Estate,Redhawk

Australia,"Like many Mornington producers, Kooyong has a relatively short track record (founded 1996). For much of that time, winemaking was under the guidance of Sandro Mosele, including this stunning 2012. It shows Burgundian levels of complexity in its array of smoke, leather, root vegetable and black cherry notes, then backs that all up with a firm-yet-supple texture and tremendous length. Drink now through 2022.",93,55.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,Joe Czerwinski,2012,1.0,Estate,Kooyong
Australia,"The 2015 vintage in Mornington yielded dark concentrated wines. This one is atypically (for the estate) full bodied and bold as a result, with plum and black-cherry fruit and hints of mint, sage and bay leaf. Long and a bit drying on the finish, it needs a couple of years to come into balance. Drink 2020–2030.",92,56.0,Victoria,Mornington Peninsula,Joe Czerwinski,2015,1.0,Estate,Kooyong

US,"Tempranillo has become a mainstay red grape in southern Oregon, but it's a rarity further north. Light toasty fruit flavors suggest tart raspberry with a hint of wood from 14 months in 20% new American oak barrels.

US,"Significantly full and expansive in vanilla, lemon curd and toasty oak, the Durell Vineyard shows its power here, generous in ripe flavors and rich earth.

Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2014,1.0,Estate,Melville
US,"Made in a more reductive style, this bottling conveys a tremendously intriguing sense of yogurt and Brie cheese rind on the nose, with orange rind, guava skin, green pear, tuberose and graphite notes. The palate grips with a pear skin and lime-zest tang, and that dairy note holds strong.",90,26.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2014,2.0,Estate,Melville
US,"A brilliant balance of ripe ruby-red grapefruit juice and corresponding bitter-sour elements from the same fruit's pith mesh with tangerine oil, crushed ant, iodine and a bit of dairy funk on the nose of this wine. The palate's grippy texture shows apple peels, Key lime pith, baking soda and an almost peppery zing, suggesting lots of life. Drink 2016–2023.",93,26.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2013,2.0,Estate,Melville
US,"Bacon fat, blackberry jam and black pepper combine for a classic and inviting nose on this bottling from the family-owned winery and winemaker Greg Brewer.

Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2013,6.0,Estate,Melville
US,"There's intriguing precision to the nose of this bottling from Chad Melville and family. A laser-sharp line of tart elderberry, black-plum skins and black-cherry skins cut through the dark earth, tar and purple-flower elements. The palate blends approachable black raspberry, dark strawberry and muddled mulberry fruit with touches of coffee and dark cocoa.",91,32.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2014,6.0,Estate,Melville

US,"A blend of three estate-farmed vineyards, this is a velvety-smooth expression of the variety. It conveys a touch more richness and concentration than some of the producer's other wines, at least at the beginning of the glass, when almond and hazelnut rule the day. But then it takes on a lightness toward the lengthy finish, ending in a mix of lemon zest and apple.",90,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,2.0,Estate,Thomas George
US,"One of the many estate Pinot Noirs produced by the pioneering Arroyo Grande Valley winery, which was founded as a sparkling wine house, this offers scents of sandalwood, black licorice and red currant.

US,"This is a very pale Chardonnay from Laetitia Winery, which sits just three miles from the ocean amidst vineyards planted on rocky clay loam, and yet possesses an appealing, complex mix of creaminess and crispiness on the nose. There is a slight bitterness on the palate as well as brioche and citrus zest on the finish. This tightly focused wine would perfectly cut the richness of shrimp scampi or other buttery dish.",89,18.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Matt Kettmann,2012,2.0,Estate,Laetitia

US,"Extremely fresh and lively aromas of soft strawberry and lime pith combine to make a very racy edge to the nose of this bottling from the pioneering property, which was founded as a bubbly house in the early 1980s. There is great energy to the sip, where somewhat sour flavors of Ruby Red grapefruit rind give the wine lots of acidic length.",90,34.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Matt Kettmann,2014,21.0,Brut Rosé,Laetitia
US,"From an estate just northwest of the already rather western Sta. Rita Hills appellation, this mashes up raspberry, oak tree roots, black tea and vanilla on the nose.

US,"Though reserved in the nose, this wine from a vineyard to the west of the Sta. Rita Hills already presents a bit of aromatic age, with honey, almond and dried apricot.

US,"This bottling, all estate, mixes a number of different vineyard blocks. Roughly one-third was whole-cluster fermented, and it all spent 17 months in 58% new French oak. Earthy with a hint of resin and bark, its fruit runs to cranberry and raspberry, fully ripened with excellent concentration. The finish is a bit high-toned, leaving an impression of tart pie cherries.",90,50.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Paul Gregutt,2013,1.0,Estate,Cristom

US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is brooding in dried sage, cedar and pencil shavings, the fruit black and ripe. Oaky and sanguine, it has a girth to it. Sprinkles of cinnamon and clove peak on the finish.",87,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Estate,Buehler
US,"This rich wine smells sweet and tastes jammy, as strawberry and boysenberry flood the palate. Full body and a smoothly dense texture complete the picture.",88,26.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2014,4.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"A soft, subdued Sierra Foothills Cab with the right amount of blackberry and chocolate throughout and what smells like a handful of coconut flakes for good measure.",87,25.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Virginie Boone,2008,4.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"This looks deep and dark, smells like Port and tastes almost as rich as that. However, it's dry and not too high in alcohol, although the aroma and flavor of superripe grapes is similar. While bold in flavor and relatively big in texture, it's pretty smooth overall.",87,24.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2012,8.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"This is a big, bold, but welcoming wine with tons of flavor, plenty of tannin but an almost silky texture that invites another sip. The deep red-black color goes almost to the rim. Aromas are like apple skin and red cherries and the flavor suggests blackberries. Its richness without heaviness helps it stand out from the pack.",90,24.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2011,8.0,Estate,Naggiar

US,"Good depth of flavor and a nicely tannic texture make this hearty wine interesting and appetizing. Earth, oak and chocolate waft from the glass and turn to substantive red cherry and red-currant flavors on the palate, while firm tannins and good acidity give grip to the mouthfeel.",90,26.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2014,16.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"With cedar and tobacco aromas, and vivid black cherry and black currant flavors, this full-bodied red has lots of fruit character and complexity to match its firm tannins and bold texture.

US,"An exuberant boysenberry jam aroma and richly layered berry and dark chocolate flavors give lots of taste pleasure to this full-bodied and impressively textured wine. It's a monster in terms of tannin and impact on the taste buds, but not over the top in alcohol.

US,"This wine has candied fruit aromas and flavors, plus heat in the aroma and in the mouth.",82,29.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2012,29.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"Naggiar makes at least 15 wines from its estate vineyard, and really hit a home run with this classic that should have a long life ahead of it. The color is dark and intense right to the rim, while aromas blend a subtle spiciness with bold and complex fruit notes. Flavors convey concentrated dark chocolate, black cherry and espresso. It's enjoyable now with big proteins, but will be best after 2020.",94,29.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2014,29.0,Estate,Naggiar

US,"Made in a complex style rather than simply fruity, this smells like toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Tastes suggest not-quite-sweet Bosc pears, butter and walnuts. While the texture is luxurious the body is actually light, and the wine is not at all cloying.",90,21.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2014,25.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"This well-balanced wine has light floral, appley aromas, good acidity to drive its mouth-filling fruit flavors along, and just enough body to contribute a smooth mouthfeel. Hints of white pepper and lemon zest give it an attractive savory edge.",89,24.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2016,25.0,Estate,Naggiar

US,"It's easy for Grenache to get too heavy and rich, but this one doesn't. It's a sophisticated, medium-weight red wine that has the flavor complexity, good acidity and firm texture to make a good pairing with different dishes, from mushrooms to fowl to beef to game.",89,24.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2011,26.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"Attractive oaky, well-aged aromas and flavors make this wine mellow and multi-faceted. It leads with cedar and cigar-box aromas, followed by touches of cherry and plum. The body is full, adding to the moderately tannic texture.",87,28.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2012,44.0,Estate,Naggiar
US,"Deep color and lots of concentration make this full-bodied wine stand out. It has smoky, black-peppery aromas along with ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors. Firm tannins add texture. This boldness needs rich food for a pairing.",90,37.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2014,31.0,Reserve,Naggiar
US,"Richness makes this wine exceptional, while it still keeps its varietal personality. Aromas are grapy, almost jammy, then the flavors are quite fruity and berrylike, accented by mineral and chocolate notes. A finely tannic texture braces everything for an appetizing mouthfeel.",91,24.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2013,16.0,Estate Grown,Naggiar

US,"A subtle style of Viognier, this has body and presence without overt fruit flavors. It soothes the palate with a creamy viscosity. Modest apple and mineral flavors interact with crisp acidity for a low-key, reserved and well-mannered personality.",90,21.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2013,25.0,Estate Grown,Naggiar
US,"Two profiles emerge in this deep-colored, ripe-tasting and very dry Barbera. It smells and, at first, tastes almost overripe and pruny, with a soft, broad texture. Then the firm acidity and slightly tough tannins kick in on the finish. Not an ideal balance, but it will be good with especially rich dishes.",83,25.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2010,31.0,Estate Grown,Naggiar
US,"This bold, full-bodied wine with lots of fruit flavor seems to have faded a bit. It shows volatile aromas and overripe fruit notes that are getting a bit frayed around the edges.",82,27.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2011,44.0,Estate Grown,Naggiar

US,"This wine is quite an accomplishment in flavor and complexity given the vintage and the price. From high-altitude vineyards atop the Mayacamas, it delivers peppercorn, herb and fine, well-integrated tannins, with mellow oak. Graphite and cedar also figure into the mix, with a shock of black cherry and cassis weaved within.

Drink now through 2021.",91,40.0,California,Alexander Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Estate Vineyards,Stonestreet
US,"Viscous and dark in the glass, this can be none other than a Daou wine. The telltale crème de cassis, black cherry, mocha and espresso aromas lead to a palate of exotic black spice and concentrated fruit, its blackberry and blueberry flavors accented with hoisin notes. It has enough structure to age but is also accessible now.",94,85.0,California,Adelaida District,Matt Kettmann,2014,4.0,Estate,Daou
US,"The Daou brothers aren't known for subtlety, so it's no surprise that this Sauvignon Blanc is rich and plush with oak-kissed peach, smoked apple and toasted nut aromas.

US,"Mocha cream, pencil shaving and dried herb aromas are set against a backdrop of black currant fruit in this big but balanced bottling from the Daou brothers. It's soft on the palate, where the texture commands as much attention as the flavors, in a matrix of mouth-coating tannins that frame its cola, cocoa, black plum and cherry notes.",94,85.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2014,4.0,Reserve,Daou
US,"A very high-toned, wound-up nose slowly reveals chalky aromas, concentrated purple fruit and crushed violets on this bottling by the Daou brothers. The palate is also tight and slow to release, with hints of dark chocolate chips, espresso bean and black fruit lingering behind a walls of tannins and bright acidity. This will age well, but certainly wait a little longer to open.",90,56.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2012,4.0,Reserve,Daou
US,"There is an oaky toastiness to the nose of this bottling, which shows light browned butter, honeysuckle and struck match aromas.

US,"Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life.

US,"This Napa producer based in the Chiles Valley has made a big style of Cab here, with plenty of tannins and black currant aromas and flavor but the wine's acidity tastes a touch out of balance and could improve with time. Producer recommends waiting to open until 2013.",87,50.0,California,Chiles Valley,Virginie Boone,2006,4.0,Estate,RustRidge

Age 3–5 years.",88,29.0,California,El Dorado,Virginie Boone,2008,4.0,Estate,Cedarville Vineyard

US,"Cedarville is loved for its Syrah and Grenache but it can expertly handle its estate Zinfandel too—grown at 2,500-foot elevation—This smoky, raspberry-wrapped, silky wine is full of big, round mountain tannins yet somehow manages to be light on its feet on the finish. Have it with sticky ribs.",89,22.0,California,El Dorado,Virginie Boone,2009,13.0,Estate,Cedarville Vineyard

US,"Cedarville remains an estate producer to follow in the Foothills, melding a well-farmed site with clean, clear winemaking in the cellar. Grown on decomposed granite hillsides, this Syrah has 4% Viognier, just the right touch to bring out the best aromatics, highlighted by sage. Dark, earthy and leathery, this wine is holding onto its tannin and oak, but given time to rest in the cellar 5–7 years, it'll scream to be served with cassoulet.",91,25.0,California,El Dorado,Virginie Boone,2010,6.0,Estate,Cedarville Vineyard

US,"This 100% varietal wine comes off as quite ripe. Aromas of woodspice and caramel lead to full-bodied, sweet and quite boozy cherry flavors, with grainy tannins backing it all up.",88,38.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,43.0,Estate,Gifford Hirlinger
US,"Toasty and firm, this pure Petit Verdot is rich with black cherry and cassis. Whiffs of smoke and a slight burn in the finish suggest that further bottle age will bring in more barrel nuances (from 40% new American oak) and smooth out the finish.",89,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,43.0,Estate,Gifford Hirlinger
US,"Lush black plum, bramble and black pepper mingle with cedar and spicy oak notes in this wine. These extend to the palate, where licorice and dried herbs linger. This wine is deep and extracted, so the full tannic structure does not seem out of place.",87,34.0,Virginia,Middleburg,Carrie Dykes,2014,4.0,Estate,Casanel
US,"An intriguing nose of lemon, pineapple, vanilla and banana candies are encased in a waft of warm yeast. Flavors of honeydew, more pineapple and oak spice are folded into a saline and nutty component. The weight is plush and feels silky on the tongue.",87,20.0,Virginia,Middleburg,Carrie Dykes,2015,2.0,Estate,Casanel
US,"This wine has is high-toned in aromas with raisin, terriyaki, red currant and charred oak. The palate is a bit muted on the fruit tones, with red currant pervading and secondary characteristics of coffee and chocolate in the background. This is a big wine with chewy tannins, a full body and puckery acidity.",85,36.0,Virginia,Middleburg,Carrie Dykes,2014,43.0,Estate,Casanel
US,"A deep color and aromas of toasted baguette, wood smoke and black cherry signal a classic style. The flavors are like dark-chocolate-covered cherries and cranberries. The toasted character of new oak barrels persists from the aroma to the finish, but it's well complemented by ripe fruit, an impressively tannic texture and lingering finish.",95,165.0,California,Napa Valley,Jim Gordon,2012,4.0,Estate,Hourglass
US,"An extremely dark color sets an expectation of concentration, and this full-bodied but velvet-textured wine delivers it. In the aroma are cocoa and licorice and dark-skinned cherries, then the flavors resemble a rich blackberry cherry syrup without the sweetness. The wine tastes exceptionally rich but not heavy. Best from 2020 through 2030.",95,185.0,California,Napa Valley,Jim Gordon,2013,4.0,Estate,Hourglass
US,"This beautifully brings out and blends the crisp citrus side of the grape variety along with a touch of riper fruit flavor that's shaped by oak aging. It offers classic, grassy aromas, thirst-quenchingly tart flavors and very light touches of vanilla and nutmeg.",91,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Jim Gordon,2013,12.0,Estate,Hourglass
US,"Absolutely clean, fresh and vibrant, this wine smells like sliced lemons, limes and Granny Smith apples, with lively tastes to match. Full bodied, and energized with bright acidity on first sip, it rounds off on the palate and finish, turning softer and richer.",91,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Jim Gordon,2014,12.0,Estate,Hourglass
US,"An enticing, spicy, cedary, toasty aroma leads to generous flavors of black cherry, wood smoke and dried plum. The body is full, the texture is bold, firmly tannic and buoyed by acidity that provides grip on the palate and makes it a great match for rich proteins. Best after 2019.",92,40.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Jim Gordon,2012,4.0,Estate,Easton
US,"Bold and ripe in taste, this full-bodied wine packs in plump blackberry and boysenberry flavors, a rich texture from firm tannins and lip-smacking acidity that keeps it lively. Slow-cooked ribs, anyone?",89,35.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Jim Gordon,2012,13.0,Estate,Easton
US,"This wine won't be available until 2013/2014, but for the moment it is a mouthful of extremely ripe blackberry and blueberry jam, with layers of tar and dirt. Big and ripe, the additional time in bottle will help smooth out its edges.",88,32.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Virginie Boone,2009,13.0,Estate,Easton

US,"Known more for Zinfandel and Rhône blends, Bill Easton has quietly been making Cabernet as well for many years. This vintage is earthy and leathery, reminiscent of his Syrah-based wines, yet rich in savory black cherry, cedar and black olive. Built to age, put it away until 2019–2024 and the savory, herbal elements are sure to develop further.",90,50.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Virginie Boone,2011,4.0,Estate Bottled,Easton

US,"Dark in color and deep in heavily ripened fruit flavors, this full-bodied, concentrated wine is a show-stopper. A quiet sense of power comes from the dried plum and raisin aromas and the rich blueberry, clove and dark-chocolate flavors. This is a keeper that will be best to drink after 2020.",93,35.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Jim Gordon,2014,13.0,Estate Bottled,Easton
US,"This big and dry wine is a nice change of pace. The wine looks dark, smells deep and tastes full bodied and firm textured. It doesn't have the overripe or semisweet character of many Zins, but instead is rather tannic and even mildly astringent like strong tea, and has lip smacking cranberry and raspberry flavors.",90,35.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Jim Gordon,2013,13.0,Estate Bottled,Easton
US,"A robust Zin, this wine's lusty, cinnamon-spice aromas carry through on the tongue, while the texture is refined and rich. With balanced alcohol and acidity, its full-figured body is still juicy and bright. Cellar it for a few more years or let it breathe before serving.",90,32.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Virginie Boone,2011,13.0,Estate Bottled,Easton
US,"Edgy with mountainous berry flavor, Easton's 2010 Shenandoah Valley Zin is full-bodied, generous in savory spices and blackberry flavor and intoxicatingly aromatic with a peppery, leathery finish. It's structurally able to withstand many more years in bottle, so enjoy it now or give it some time. Either way, it'll shine poured alongside peppery meat.",93,32.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Virginie Boone,2010,13.0,Estate Bottled,Easton
US,"Minerals and earth lift the nose of this wine, with iron ore, rust and jet black soils alongside a touch of boysenberry fruit. The palate is sanguine as well, reflecting red volcanic dirts, with fruit trending toward violet and cranberry.",89,34.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2012,4.0,Estate,Pomar Junction
US,"This wine from the recently approved El Pomar District is tropically perfumed with lychee candy and a hint of passionfruit. Bouncy acidity on the front of the palate leads into red apple fruit and citrus skin bitterness, and wipes up with a zing on the palate.",88,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2013,25.0,Estate,Pomar Junction
US,"Deeply purple aromas of acai fruit and grape Jolly Rancher candies get a bit more serious with the scent of smoked cigars.

US,"Dust, pipe ash and pencil shavings give an Old World vibe to the nose. The palate offers very austere blackberry and soil flavors. Serve with pot roast or cigars.",86,34.0,California,Carmel Valley,Matt Kettmann,2011,4.0,Estate,Joullian
US,"Tropical scents of guava and cherimoya with the mineral edge of concrete lead the aromatics on this Carmel Valley wine.

Argentina,"Dark, minty and fiery on first take, this folds in aromas of licorice and oaky lemon peel along with spicy berry fruit. Firm and tightly built, this is spicy, peppery and chocolaty on a canvas of berry and cassis. Powerful, toasty and a touch hot on the finish.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Estate,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Crisp minerally aromas of cherry and blackberry come with toasty spicy accents. This is a tightly built full-bodied Cab with lightly herbal, moderately oaky and saucy flavors of berry and plum. A dry, spicy finish provides for a strong ending.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,4.0,Estate,Alta Vista

Argentina,"Fragrant lemon-lime and exotic bath soap aromas lead this wine. A round, oily feeling palate is full for the variety, with flavors of mixed citrus fruits, honey and lychee. Potent acidity creates some burn on the finish.",88,20.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2014,37.0,Estate,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Tropical fruit aromas come with notes of bath soap and white-flower blossom. This is easygoing and healthy on the palate, with just enough snappy acidity. Flavors of lime and green banana run long on the finish, which shows a touch of the variety's patented oily bitterness. Drink immediately.",89,19.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2015,37.0,Estate,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Somewhat murky and smelling of compost and green berry fruit. Feels full and wide, with a hard palate containing milk chocolate and molasses flavors. Finishes bitter, dark and herbal, with gripping tannins. Tasted twice.",83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Classic,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel. The wine is sincerely syrupy and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but it struggles with balance and comes across heavy, roasted and loaded down with candied berry and milk chocolate flavors.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Classic,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Red berry and cola aromas come with a cool menthol note. It feels chunky and jammy; the moderate-to-soft acidity creates a rubbery palate, with cherry and plum flavors. The finish turns sweet like caramel and slightly stewed.",87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Classic,Alta Vista
Argentina,"This is mellow up front, with mild aromas of melon and baby powder. It feels fresh and easygoing, with apple, citrus and vanilla flavors. Drink well chilled, and soon.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,2.0,Classic,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Round, melony and pleasant, with tropical/floral aromas. Flavorwise, it's all about medium-intensity melon and lychee, and as Torrontés goes this one is likable and well made. It covers the tropical fruit bases and adds in some peppery dryness on the finish.",87,12.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2008,37.0,Classic,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Now at the end of its peak, this is showing mature lychee, melon and soft-fruit aromas along with citrus, mango and nectarine flavors. It's tasty and pure, with only a slight bit of oily harshness that most Torrontés show. Drink immediately or wait for the 2010.",88,12.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2009,37.0,Classic,Alta Vista
Argentina,"A little heavy and teetering toward overripeness, but it holds the line despite issuing aromas of raisin, heat, leather and marinated meat. The mouth is sweet and big-boned, with good tannic structure. Tastes a touch roasted and/or burnt on the finish. Gets it more right than wrong.",87,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Premium,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Floral, reedy aromas of red berry fruits and plum lead to a ripe, saturated palate with earthy, stewed flavors of prune and blackberry. The prune continues on the finish, which brings saltiness and a chocolaty nuance.",87,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Premium,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Minerally and firm on the nose, it bursts with blackberry and plum aromas. In the mouth, this is lively and medium bodied, while nice acidity allows it to roll over the palate while showing earthy flavors of black fruits and rubber. A saucy, leathery, meaty-tasting finish is friendly in feel.",90,22.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Premium,Alta Vista
Argentina,"There's more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young, everyday Malbec, and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep. As might be expected given the aromas, the palate is limited to herbal, lightly pickled red fruit, while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate. Decent wine, but that's as far as it goes.",84,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Premium,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Sweet, tropical aromas lead the way, followed by notes of melon and vanilla. It feels fresh, with citrus and lychee flavors. The finish is tropical and green tasting, with nervy acidity.",87,20.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2011,37.0,Premium,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Citrus and tropical fruit aromas blend together in clean, attractive fashion. The palate is crisp and cleansing due to firm acidity, while flavors of lime and pithy orange finish tight. This is a clean, clear presentation of Salta Torrontés.",87,20.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2012,37.0,Premium,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Lychee and melon aromas dance with sweeter scents of air freshener and perfume. The palate is zesty and driven, with narrow tangerine and orange flavors. Flashy Torrontes is what this is; it delivers the goods but doesn't step too hard on the gas pedal. Drink now.",87,14.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2007,37.0,Premium,Alta Vista
Argentina,"Raspberry and plum aromas include notes of brown sugar and warm pavement. A dense, chewy palate is packed with fruit and tannins. Flavors of minty oak and berry fruits dissolve into a heap of tannin and oak on the finish.",88,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2016,4.0,Estate,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Medicinal cherry and plum aromas set up a palate with clipped, hard tannins. Forced flavors of oak and carob are more obvious than the wine's plum and cassis notes. Oak dominates the creamy, charred finish.",85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2016,8.0,Estate,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Clean, fresh, stony aromas are basic but good. A round palate benefits from citric kick, while this tastes of mixed tropical fruits backed by skins-based bitterness.",87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2015,2.0,Estate,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and suggest notes of cured meat and cheese. It gets tougher and more tannic the more it breathes, with black fruit, herb and spice flavors. Generous but rough in feel, it has a powerful, medium-long finish.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2011,4.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Santa Carolina of Chile is behind this Uco Valley producer, and for two years running this wine has rated the same. It starts with adequate but generic plum and blackberry aromas, yet the palate is acidic and tangy, with slightly herbal black fruit and raspberry flavors. Decent but not what you'd call a distinguished Cabernet. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2007,4.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Opens with rubbery, gaseous aromas that morph into latex and finally briary berry. The palate has a highly regular, tannic feel along with minty, generic flavors of berry and herbs. Basil and spice notes show up on the mildly green finish. Contains 15% Malbec and Syrah.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Pushy, smoky, forceful aromas of roasted blackberry and campfire set up a sticky feeling, slightly gummy palate that's full of berry, plum and rubbery flavors. On the finish, this flattens out and becomes heavier.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"From Santa Carolina, this Malbec is what you'd call meaty but a little raisiny. It shows signs of mild reduction, which pushes the flavors to marmalade. Pepper and a little coffee-like bitterness on the finish close the show. Drink now. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Toasty, smoky black-fruit aromas come with a fair amount of density and char. This is plush but balanced, with blackberry, blueberry and toasty oak flavors. A solid but quick finish isn't complex but it does confirm the wine's quality. The wine is 85% Malbec with the remainder Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",89,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Blackberry and animal aromas precede a rubbery, tannic, full-bodied palate.

Argentina,"For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.",85,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,2.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2012,25.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Starts out volatile, with a burning sensation to the nose. After settling, the palate shows heat along with baked apple, melon and bitterness. Finishes solid but pithy, with some leftover heat.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2010,25.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Neutral aromas and a mouthfeel with modest lemony acidity set up pithy citrus flavors and notes of green melon and lychee.

The finish is creamy, tropical and slightly bitter.",88,12.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2011,37.0,Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Berry and cassis aromas are spicy and powerful, with integrated oak in support. This solid, tough wine features rugged but fair tannins. Savory berry, baked notes, leather and herbal flavors are very Cabernet-ish, while the finish is dry, firm and tannic.

Argentina,"Alluring, attractive aromas of tree bark, licorice, fig and blackberry feed into a layered, concentrated palate with plum, blackberry and peppery flavors.

Drink through 2023.",92,23.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Gran Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",80,18.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Gran Reserva,Finca El Origen

A roasted-tasting finish features notes of cooked brown sugar.",89,23.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Gran Reserva,Finca El Origen
Argentina,"Heavy oak and caramel aromas are dominant, with suggestions of mocha and sawdust. This is tight and drawing on the palate, with wood-dominated flavors of resin, clove and distant berry fruits. This simmers with oak and clove on the finish, but should clean up with another year or so in bottle. Drink through 2017.",89,23.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Gran Reserva,Finca El Origen
US,"From an older block of estate vineyard, planted to budwood originally sourced from Martha's Vineyard, this 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot and 10% Malbec is not for the faint of heart or palate. Burly and expansive, its aromatics star, inviting in cedar, mocha and vanilla before black pepper and cherry take over. The tannins are velvety.",90,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Estate,Von Strasser
US,"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, along with 20% Malbec, all from the producer's estate.

US,"Estate-grown and aged patiently for 30 months in American oak, this is a beautifully-balanced, medium-bodied wine. It has the kind of grip on the palate that's great with rich foods and a very agreeable cherry-berry fruit flavor. The tannin component is firm and the acidity is lively, so each sip cleans the mouth for another bite of food.",90,30.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2011,4.0,Estate,Martin Lane Winery
US,"Still tight and young, this tastes like a keeper that will improve with time. Aged in all new American barrels, it shows aromas of coriander, cumin and smoke, with flavors like black cherry and black pepper.

US,"Picked a bit soon due to an early freeze in 2009, this had plenty of sugar ripeness but lost a bit of the complexity that extra time on the vine can bring.

US,"Full bodied and fruity, the 2010 estate Syrah from Va Piano is rounder and less herbal than the 2009. Which style you enjoy is a matter of individual preference. Big and approachable, with lovely blueberry fruit, the 2010 seems to stop a bit short, but with more bottle age may reveal details that are currently in hiding.",90,48.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,6.0,Estate,Va Piano

US,"A small percentage of Petit Verdot helps darken this wine, a touch of saddle and leather at the fore of the aroma. From there, inky blackberry and plum jockey for position against the solid oak and firm-grained tannin, a call out for steak clearly heard.",89,38.0,California,Alexander Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Estate,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"Spicy Asian pear dominates in this low-to-no-oak white, medium-bodied and jumping in savory thyme. Aromas of peaches also come into play, before this wine finishes crisp and clean.",88,25.0,California,Alexander Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Estate,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"Muted on the nose, this soft wine co-fermented with 9% Petite Sirah offers rich red cherry, blackberry and layers of clove and lavender. Lush, it finishes in firm tannins and oak.",88,28.0,California,Alexander Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,13.0,Estate,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
Argentina,"Grapey berry aromas come with sweet, reedy notes and a brandied cherry component. It feels condensed but lively, with a mix of sweet, almost tropical flavors that hint at pineapple, wild berry and herb. Tasted twice; this score and note reflects both tastings.",85,16.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"Woody and dense at first, this smells bright and fruity as it opens. A solid palate houses lightly toasted flavors of blackberry that turn more peppery and toasty on a fairly oaky finish.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"Rustic, rubbery, leathery aromas are highly suggestive of animal hide and stalky berry fruits. This is hard as rocks on the palate, with an astringent mouthfeel. Briny, leathery berry and plum flavors end with a stalky aftertaste.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"Bold, aggressive aromas of shoe polish, grainy oak, campfire and heat lead to a grabby, wide palate with sweet flavors of candied fruit and marshmallow. There's a lot of superficiality here, particular oak, but there's also legitimate Malbec fruit and character that make it worthwhile.",85,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"Soft and earthy up front, this Malbec deals jammy, raisiny aromas and a note of charcoal. The palate is cushioned in feel, while flavors of prune and blackberry are ripe but also minerally. Blackberry and raisin flavors are at the center of a lightly herbal,  persistent finish.",88,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"Grapey and inky on the nose, this feels saturated and a bit hot on the palate, with a candied blueberry flavor leading to a grapey finish. Tasted twice, months apart, with similar findings; this score reflects both tastings.",85,16.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"High-elevation aromas of blueberry, herbs and bramble are accented by cumin and spiced-plum notes. This displays ample size and grip, while flavors of roasted plum and savory spices are earthy. On the finish, this is oaky and minty tasting.",87,16.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"Pungent aromas of tangerine and passionfruit get it going, so it's not shocking that the palate is zesty and citric, with flavors of passionfruit, lemon and orange. A little dilute in body, with passionfruit as the prime survivor on the finish.",85,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,12.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"This opens with a gaseous, sulfuric scent followed by aromas of peach pit, apricot, green apple and wet stones. The palate is lean and zesty, while flavors of lemon, tangerine and nectarine finish with a blend of raw acidity and oaky vanilla.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2012,2.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting. The palate maintains a light, juicy, citric feel as it delivers flavors of melon, apple and banana. Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.",87,16.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2010,37.0,Estate,Doña Paula
Argentina,"This Torrontés is fading. After aromas of air freshener and lychee, the wine feels heavy and clampy, with an oily character. Its tropical flavors are unimpressive, while the finish is round in feel but bitter in taste. Better to wait for the 2012, or even the 2013, to come around.",83,16.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2011,37.0,Estate,Doña Paula
US,"Bright, crisp red cherry and blackberry flavors drive a refreshing, fruity personality. Touches of nutmeg and vanilla show through, but this is not an oaky wine by any means. It will please a crowd and pair well with a wide variety of foods.",87,40.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2012,4.0,Estate,Wise Villa
US,"This bright and attractive dry wine has exotic floral and pistachio aromas, rich grapefruit and rosewater flavors, and a lively texture that seems to keep the flavors tripping over the tongue on the aftertaste. It will be a real treat for brunch or with spicy food.",90,30.0,California,Alta Mesa,Jim Gordon,2014,37.0,Estate,Wise Villa
US,"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character.",86,35.0,California,Placer County,Jim Gordon,2013,16.0,Estate Grown,Wise Villa
US,"This bold, full-bodied and flavorful wine wraps ripe, generous blackberry flavors in a blanket of fine-grained tannins that helps support the richness and keep the wine in balance. It's from a little-known, tiny winery doing interesting things.",91,35.0,California,Placer County,Jim Gordon,2013,29.0,Estate Grown,Wise Villa
US,"This exotic and memorable white wine brings a floral, perfumed aroma, ripe fruit flavors and a nicely viscous texture. Rather light in body for its richness level, it delivers a lingering finish. It has the generous texture of a Chardonnay but with more intense fruit flavors.",90,30.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2013,37.0,Estate Grown,Wise Villa

US,"A dark-golden SB from the Sierra Foothills with a nose full of honeysuckle and mango, this wine's got significant depth and concentration but also a healthy dose of alcohol (14.7%) and is a tad sweet on the finish. A small amount of Sémillon is blended in for body and texture. Pair with seafood.",86,14.0,California,El Dorado,Virginie Boone,2009,12.0,Estate,Lava Cap

US,"This wine beautifully blends vivid fruit, enticing spice and luxuriously creamy flavors that are concentrated, layered and complex. It pulls it all off gracefully due to underlying acidity that supports a lush texture and leads to a long finish.",92,22.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2015,2.0,Reserve,Lava Cap
US,"Even with Merlot and Cabernet Franc in the mix, there's no mistaking this is a Zinfandel. It has pepper and jam flavors, with straightjacketlike tannins and plenty of body.",87,24.0,California,El Dorado,Virginie Boone,2010,13.0,Reserve,Lava Cap
US,"Lava Cap has made a decent version of Barbera here, simple and blueberry-toned but the wine is a tad heavy and overly oaked and bitter on the finish.",85,20.0,California,El Dorado,Virginie Boone,2008,31.0,Reserve,Lava Cap
US,"This Cab has a prominent streak of eucalyptus-like menthol on the nose as well as cranberry. This continues on the palate, which is fairly juicy and soft. With dry tannins the finish is on the dusty side, a pairing quandary solved most likely by juicy red meat.",87,25.0,California,El Dorado,Virginie Boone,2010,4.0,Estate Bottled,Lava Cap
US,"Pure, concentrated grape flavors fill up this full-bodied and well-balanced wine. It's a pleasure to smell and taste the black currant and cherry character, deftly and lightly accented by baking spice. The velvety texture fills the mouth and propels those flavors through a lingering finish. It will drink best after 2018.",93,28.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2014,4.0,Estate Bottled,Lava Cap
US,"Full bodied, full flavored and satisfyingly tannic, this bold wine smells like dark plums, tastes like black cherries and blueberries ,and feels smooth but gripping in texture. It will drink best after 2017.",90,26.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2013,4.0,Estate Bottled,Lava Cap

US,"Light herb aromas and vivid apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine delicious, while the tangy, nervy texture keeps the mouth tingling. It has great balance, concentration and length on the finish.",90,18.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2015,12.0,Estate Bottled,Lava Cap
US,"A compellingly fresh herbal component characterizes this wine, particularly in the aroma. Still-tight tannins give a bitter note.

The fruit flavors go deep, while fine-grained tannins frame them perfectly for excellent overall structure and harmony.",92,24.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2013,6.0,Estate Bottled,Lava Cap
US,"A decadent, dark and meaty Syrah, with plenty of sauvage tendencies amid a rich, velvety texture that finishes long and lushly perfumed with sweet smoke.

US,"This is a firmly structured and full-bodied wine with great grip in the texture and lots of oak flavor and tannin.

US,"This winery's young estate vineyard shows lots of promise. Aromas of dried herbs, bittersweet chocolate, mineral, licorice, raspberry and cherry lead to textured, rich cranberry flavors with a firm handshake of tannins and a tart, cranberry-filled finish. It needs time to all come together but has the stuffing to go the distance.",92,80.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Estate,Force Majeure
US,"From this winery's young estate vineyard, this displays aromas of crushed rock, plum, raspberries and herbs along with coffee accents. It's rich and concentrated with layers of red and black fruit flavors. A firm squeeze of grainy tannins could use additional time to unwind. It will be best from 2020 to 2025.",92,65.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,6.0,Estate,Force Majeure
US,"The aromas are light initially, with notes of cocoa, herb, barrel spice and cherry not yet fully ready to reveal their charms. The cherry and bittersweet chocolate flavors are backed by lightly grainy tannins that need some time to unwind. The wood is intense at present but there are good things underneath.",91,95.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Estate Grown,Force Majeure
US,"Though Viognier only makes up 1% of this wine, it substantially lifts the aromas, which bring notes of wild flowers along with blue and black fruit. The flavors are bold and full bodied, pulling no punches but showing exquisite concentration and length.",93,70.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,6.0,Estate Grown,Force Majeure

It's an all-in-all juicy wine that balances Napa exuberance against a sense of elegance.",92,100.0,California,Rutherford,Virginie Boone,2011,4.0,Estate,St. Supéry
US,"Licorice and black plum notes give this wine a sultry edge, layered around generous tannin and leathery tobacco. Soft toward the finish, it provides a polished note of red currant and raspberry midway through, lifting much of the weight off the tongue. Cellar through 2020.",90,50.0,California,Rutherford,Virginie Boone,2012,17.0,Estate,St. Supéry
US,"Cedar dust, dried herb, currant and graphite combine effortlessly in this restrained wine, subtle in buried tannin. It shows voluptuous body with moderate acidity and a ripeness on the finish.",89,65.0,California,Rutherford,Virginie Boone,2013,19.0,Estate,St. Supéry
US,"A tight, concentrated wine made in larger quantities than many of the producer's other Cabernets, this is approachable and medium bodied, featuring aromas and flavors of savory black tea and olive.",87,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Estate Bottled,St. Supéry
US,"Racy, this stainless-steel fermented white is fuzzy in gooseberry and pineapple, not quite veering into fresh-cut grass, but staying more tropical and generous in ripe fruit. A dry, lemony finish provides refreshment.",85,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,12.0,Estate Grown,St. Supéry
US,"With grapes from the estate vineyard, Minnick Hills, this promising effort opens with concentrated, dark berry fruit, backed with rich tannins. The fruit and muscle hold down the center, but the finish gets a bit chalky, and the tannins are not quite fully ripe. The best is yet to come from this estate.",88,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,4.0,Estate,Dumas Station
US,"Three quarters Merlot, with 17% Cabernet Franc and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a bit lighter than the 2007 Merlot, but just as good, if not better. Lush and loaded with black cherry, blackberry, cocoa and baking spices, it extends deliciously and seamlessly into a long, ripe, smooth finish.",92,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,17.0,Estate,Dumas Station
US,"Rarely does a Merlot in this price range display this much power and concentration. Sourced from several vineyards, it's ripe right to the border of raisin flavors, with generous dollops of maple syrup and brown sugar adding further complexity. Still fruit-driven, yet with plenty of barrel flavor, this massive Merlot can take your richest, tangiest barbecue sauce.",93,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,17.0,Estate,Dumas Station
US,"Merlot remains a solid strength at Dumas Station, thanks to the Minnick Hills and Birch Creek Vineyard fruit. Half the barrels were new, an equal percentage of French and American oak, lending a strong bourbon aroma, along with tobacco and vanilla components. The fruit remains a bit constrained, with black fruits leading into a core of cassis. Give this one a good decanting.",90,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,17.0,Estate,Dumas Station
US,"This is the winery's first Merlot. It's a simple, pleasant effort, fruit forward and lightly oaky. The usual flavors of berry are there, and the balance is fine; it just could use more concentration through the finish.",87,26.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,17.0,Estate,Dumas Station
US,"Exceptionally smooth for such a young wine, this deeply-fruited red blends pretty raspberry and cherry flavors with seductively-delicious milk-chocolaty barrel notes. Happily, there is enough natural acidity to keep it lively and fresh.",90,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,19.0,Estate,Dumas Station
US,"A great effort, with mountain-grown fruit, high-altitude acids that give the flavors shape and cut, tightening up and brightening up the sharp, wild berry fruit. Iron filings and stone add a strong mineral element as well; this is the best yet from Dumas Station.",92,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,6.0,Estate,Dumas Station
US,"The 2011 vintage was challenging for Washington in general and for the Walla Walla Valley in particular. This wine puts that aside with notes of dried cranberries and cherries along with vanilla and dry chocolate accents. The tart fruit flavors are elegant, with dry, grainy tannins along with vanilla flavors that carry through on the finish.",89,38.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2011,4.0,Estate Bottled,Dumas Station
Argentina,"Floral aromas of blueberries blend with funky notes of coffee grounds on this unusual rendering of Cabernet Sauvignon. A hard palate hammers down with tannins, tasting of burnt coffee, green herbs, spiced plum and black currant. A minty flavors rises up on a finish that pulls up short.",86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2015,4.0,Estate,Casarena
Argentina,"Minty oak aromas are the greeting on this herbal and foxy Malbec that feels crisp and chippy due to high acidity and grating tannins. Flavors of herbal berry and plum are oaky and a touch hot, while rubbery tannins and herbal berry leftovers drive the finish.",87,17.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Estate,Casarena
Argentina,"Rubbery, dense aromas are murky and on the green side as leafy, tomato notes rise up. Feels a bit thick and heavy, with herbal, sticky, sweet berry flavors mixed with a syrupy grab. Carries its weight in plodding fashion; a sweet and unctuous Cab.",84,17.0,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Estate Bottled,Casarena
Argentina,"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.",84,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Estate Bottled,Casarena
Argentina,"Hard candy and berry-extract aromas form the nose. This is slick in feel, with mulberry, raspberry, lollipop and olive flavors, a true mish-mash of tastes. A jammy sweetness drives the finish, which is short on structure.",84,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Estate Bottled,Casarena
Argentina,"This is yet another plump, sweaty smelling Sauvignon Blanc from this producer. This vintage is fat in the mouth but kept alive by adequate young acidity. Salty, briny flavors of citrus, particularly grapefruit, end in similar briny fashion.",82,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,12.0,Estate Bottled,Casarena
Argentina,"This is a rich, plush Cabernet, with a sense of elegance. It smells like prune, blackberry, coffee and toast. The concentrated palate boasts prune, olive, coffee and dark berry flavors. Drink or hold for a few years.",91,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Reserva,Casarena
Argentina,"There's a fine line between ripe and overripe, and this awkwardly toes that line with syrupy aromas and a sticky mouthfeel. Along the path are flavors of maple, fudge and stewed blackberry. A jammy, soupy, candied finish is apropos for a heavy, superripe wine such as this.",84,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserva,Casarena
US,"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish.",83,26.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2007,8.0,Estate,Gilbert Cellars
US,"First bottle corked. Second bottle sound, but rather one dimensional. The fruit is simple green apple and green berry; but there is a distinct earthy undertone that carries into the finish. If new oak barrels were used, they are not evident.",85,20.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2007,2.0,Estate,Gilbert Cellars
US,"Biscuit, burnt toast, and a hint of rubber dominate the nose. The fruit is light and somewhat buried—a little melon, unripe peach and pineapple. Perhaps too much barrel exposure, or over-toasted barrels?",85,20.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Estate,Gilbert Cellars
US,"This is a chunky, blocky, rather stolid take on what is usually a floral, perfumed grape. Here it is limited to thick fruit components —orange and guava—tart acids and some residual sweetness.",84,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,23.0,Estate,Gilbert Cellars
US,"Light, watery and thin, with simple lemon and green apple flavors, and plenty of acidity.",83,17.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Unoaked,Gilbert Cellars
US,"A vitamin pill scent greets you immediately, somewhat masking the fruit. In the mouth it's rather light, watery and showing green apple fruit with plenty of acid. The finish softens up but doesn't add any depth or flavor.",84,17.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2007,2.0,Unoaked,Gilbert Cellars
Argentina,"Concentrated savory aromas of prune, blackberry, compost and tree bark are not uncommon for Colomé. This is a clampy tannic Malbec that pulls down hard on the palate. Salty savory plum and berry flavors are oaky and finish with tannic residue. Drink through 2022.",89,30.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Estate,Colomé
Argentina,"This starts out massive and grapy, but with each passing minute it becomes more Salta, and hence more complex. Feral, leathery, roasted-berry aromas require patience. In the mouth, this is tannic and muscular, with herbal, spicy, dry flavors of blackberry and stewed plum. Raging acidity and firm tannins suggest that this needs at least until 2016 to settle.",91,30.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Estate,Colomé
Argentina,"Stalky, roasted, horsey, baked-fruit aromas are mossy and muddled. Colomé always makes funky wines with true Salta character, but this one is soupy, thick and dense in feel, with herbal, savory, salty plum flavors. A dark, chunky, stewy finish concludes this unusual rendition of Malbec.",87,30.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Estate,Colomé
Argentina,"A typically huge Colomé wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost. Fortunately it's fresher in the mouth, and the wine definitely improves with airing. Still, the palate is big and oily, with roasted berry, herb and wild, exotic flavors. A unique style of Malbec from old Calchaquí vines.",89,25.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Estate,Colomé
Argentina,"Meaty, herbal and foresty on the nose, all of which are typical aromas for this Salta-bred Malbec. Linear in the mouth and acidic as it tastes exotic due to herbal notes and eucalyptus. On the other hand it's full of blackberry and chocolaty richness. Crisp and nicely built on the finish.",88,25.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Estate,Colomé
Argentina,Citrus blossom and leesy vanilla notes open this balanced aromatic white from Argentina's north. Leesy tropcial-fruit flavors focus on lychee and lime. The wine is moderately long on a simple but solid finish.,89,15.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2016,37.0,Estate,Colomé
Argentina,"Smells cheesy and leathery, with herbal notes. Feels condensed and flat, as if it's collapsing on itself. Flavors of baked berry and prune are dark and typical of very ripe Malbec, while the finish is warm but basic in feel and flavor. Bullish, sweet and heavy. Not Colomé's best effort, especially given the price.",87,90.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Reserva,Colomé
Argentina,"Take note, this could be the best wine Colomé has ever bottled. Cedary oak aromas grace ripe, almost desiccated wild berry notes that are slightly herbal and sauvage. A well-layered mouthfeel is ideal in power and precision. Requisite blackberry, cassis, toast and peppery flavors finish dry and long, with little heat or burn. Drink through 2021.",95,90.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserva,Colomé
Argentina,"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding. A little pruney on deeper inspection, with a leathery quality to the wine's depth. Drink now through 2013.",91,90.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserva,Colomé
US,"The oak—85% new French—plays a large role, with aromas of cocoa, vanilla and woodspice playing off plum and red fruit. It's sleek and sultry in feel, with the wood getting out in front of the tart fruit flavors.",87,32.0,Washington,Lake Chelan,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,8.0,Estate,Tsillan
US,"Clocking in at a lower alcohol level than most white wines in the state let alone reds, this offers gentle aromas of raspberry, cherry and woodspice. It's light bodied, soft and airy in feel, not fully standing out on its own but perfectly suited for the dinner table.",86,28.0,Washington,Lake Chelan,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,16.0,Estate,Tsillan
US,"This brings an intriguing assortment of dried fruit including pear, spiced apple and apricot. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",87,18.0,Washington,Lake Chelan,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,25.0,Estate,Tsillan
US,"Lightly aromatic with notes of yellow apple, pear and melon. It drinks off dry, with the sugar seeming out of place but followed by an extended finish with clarifying acidity.",88,19.0,Washington,Lake Chelan,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,36.0,Estate,Tsillan
US,"The Lake Chelan appellation shows promise for white wines and this is just another example. It brings notes of rose water, spice and mandarin orange, drinking off dry, with a zip of acidity. Pair it with a spicy Thai dish.",88,14.0,Washington,Lake Chelan,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,23.0,Estate,Tsillan
US,"Aged in a mixture of new French (80%) and American oak, this leads with barrel notes of woodspice followed by herbs, brown stems, blue fruit and cinnamon. It shows good concentration with quite tart acids and dry, chalky tannins.",86,35.0,Washington,Lake Chelan,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,6.0,Estate Reserve,Tsillan
Argentina,"Leathery berry aromas are balky and dusty. Hard, dry and tannic on the palate, this shows blackberry flavors followed by dry, bitter notes. A simmering finish says this badly needs food.",85,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Estate,Don Manuel Villafañe
Argentina,"Spicy woody aromas include a note of mushroom. This feels hard and ultratannic, with acidity suggestive of red-wine vinegar. A wiry mix of salt and sour flavors is attached to savory plum fruit, while this pinches down on a drying abrasive finish.",88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Reserva,Don Manuel Villafañe
Argentina,"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas become more thin, cheesy and leathery with time. The palate is hard and narrow, with sheer flavors of generic raspberry and plum. Clacky and rough feeling on the finish.",83,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,4.0,Reserva,Don Manuel Villafañe
Argentina,"Dry, mossy berry aromas carry punch, while this well-built Malbec feels concentrated but not heavy.

Drink through 2020.",91,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserva,Don Manuel Villafañe
Argentina,"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc opens with rustic, untamed earth and leather aromas.

US,"Heftier than the producer's Platt Vineyard Pinot, this estate-grown wine features astoundingly bright acidity around dense black cherry fruit. It saw 10% stem inclusion during fermentation and was aged in 20% new oak for just over a year, a recipe that works to buoy the wine and give it plenty of complexity.",93,68.0,California,Fort Ross-Seaview,Virginie Boone,2012,1.0,Estate Vineyard,Red Car
US,"A shock of white pepper remains memorable throughout this wine, which hails from a high-elevation vineyard overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

US,"Concentrated, jammy fruit flavors meet full body and sturdy tannins in this well-made wine.

US,"Abacela's tenth vintage of Tempranillo suggests it's time to call the “experiment” a success. It's savory and scented with cured meats; a spicy red that marries black currant fruit to pepper and more exotic spices—curry, cumin and five spice. Tannins are tongue-scrapingly dry, but is there a better match for a thick steak?",91,35.0,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2006,10.0,Estate,Abacela
US,"Youthful and compact, this shows a lot of unresolved oak aromas when first opened. Slowly more complexity emerges—rose petals, tart berries, anise, cedar and ground coffee.

US,"Fragrant and dense, this sends up a lush, intriguing mix of aromas—black fruits, lead pencil, rock and green tea. It's a textural, earthy wine that never stops coming at you.

US,"Made using fruit that was sourced from 30- and 40-year-old plantings, this has captivating flavors of black cherry and cassis, wrapped in brambly hints of herb.

US,"Bold aromas, thick layers of fruit flavor, and a supple but steely texture of fine tannins and acidity add up to a powerful and complex wine that should improve with age. Pure, dark-fruit flavors are accented by smoke and cardamom while the structure is mouthpuckering with astringency but softened by the richness of body and fruit. Best after 2019.",93,30.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Jim Gordon,2012,4.0,Estate Grown,Obsidian Ridge
US,"This standout wine has an extreme color that verges on black, while exciting aromas suggest wood smoke and grilled beef, with flavors so rich they could be chocolate. The wine puts those all together without becoming heavy or too stiff in texture, although it does have a flood of fine tannins that help layer in more fruit and spices as you sip. Best after 2019.",93,30.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,Jim Gordon,2013,6.0,Estate Grown,Obsidian Ridge

Totally appetizing, dry and moreish.",92,29.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,18.0,Tradition,Domaine Pfister

France,"The domaine bottling of Saint-André de Figuière really ratchets up the quality over its négociant wines, adding much more weight and concentration. This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 20% Grenache and 25% Cinsault blends black cherry and citrus flavors into a richly textured, spicy rosé.",90,20.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,Joe Czerwinski,2007,9.0,Vieilles Vignes,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière

France,"This interesting rosé actually resembles a thirst-quenching Sauvignon Blanc in its pungent, passion-fruit aromas. It's even slightly sweaty, like some SBs (and it is a pale-hued rosé). But it's also medium to full in body, with spicy notes that recall cracked pepper and crushed ginger. Drink now.",87,16.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,Joe Czerwinski,2015,9.0,Vieilles Vignes,Château de Nages
France,"This medium-pink rosé is a blend of 40% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 20% Cinsault. A silken texture easily carries restrained fruit shadings of strawberry and kiwi, along with plummier undertones, through a long finish.

France,"This is a stony, savory style of rosé, with its ample weight backed by firm acids and only modest melon fruit. It's a style better suited to food than casual sipping on its own.",88,17.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,Joe Czerwinski,2014,9.0,Vieilles Vignes,Château de Nages
France,"This old-vine cuvée from one of the region's leading estates boasts aromas of bubble gum and passion fruit. This soon after release, that's not surprising; expect them to settle down into more restrained notes of cherry, melon and passion fruit over the next month or two. It's medium bodied and has a long, mouthwatering finish.",88,16.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,Joe Czerwinski,2016,9.0,Vieilles Vignes,Château de Nages
France,"Proprietor Michel Gassier is turning out excellent values at all levels. This supple red blends 72% Grenache with 24% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre.

Drink up.",86,15.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,Joe Czerwinski,2012,28.0,Vieilles Vignes,Château de Nages
France,"It's the extra weight that gives this wine its Réserve title. With ripe white fruits, rich acidity and just a touch of spiciness, this is a full-bodied wine, its creamed pear bringing an extra full character.",89,18.0,Alsace,Alsace,Roger Voss,2012,38.0,Réserve,Boeckel
France,"A subdued nose leads to a fresh but also subdued palate, but if you look for the ripe pear notes you will find them. This wine takes time to wake up and breathe but underneath it's an archetypal fresh but rounded Alsace Pinot Blanc.",89,14.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,38.0,Réserve,Boeckel
France,"Lovely apple fruit plays on the nose. The palate is very light and dry, but has a slightly bitter edge that suggests that this might be better with food than as an apéritif. The finish is beautifully dry and invitingly tart.",90,30.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,21.0,Brut Rosé,Boeckel
France,"Strawberry hints and floral overtones promise pleasure that arrives on the dry, creamy palate. A lively froth accentuates lightness and ease, while dryness underlines the clean fruit flavors.

France,"A touch of reduction clings to the nose, masking the fruit. On the palate, however, lemon and crisp green apple freshness prevail, carried by a soft lively mousse. This is dry, light and has a lovely backdrop of yeasty autolytic notes and a very clean finish.",89,25.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,21.0,Blanc de Blancs,Boeckel

France,White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.,90,20.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,38.0,Réserve,Domaine Weinbach
France,"This is a subtle, rich wine that exudes creamy apple and quince flavors. It has a touch of peppery spice as well as pristine fruit acidity, along with a touch of crispness on the finish. It's a wine to drink now and over the next 4–5 years.",88,18.0,Alsace,Alsace,Roger Voss,2011,38.0,Réserve,Domaine Weinbach
France,"The wine is rich, full in the mouth and delicious. With its creamy texture, baked apple flavors and sprinkling of spice, it's a dense and ripe wine that could be drunk now, but which will be better in 2016.",90,26.0,Alsace,Alsace,Roger Voss,2013,38.0,Réserve,Domaine Weinbach

US,"This 100% varietal wine hails from Blackrock, Mirage and Summit View vineyards. Barrel notes of cocoa, vanilla and coconut are at the fore, along with notes of dried cranberry and cherry. The palate is full bodied, with luscious fruit and barrel flavors that provide appeal.",88,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Reserve,Waterbrook

US,"Though not labeled as such, this is single vineyard Malbec all coming from Canyon Ranch Vineyard with varietal notes of plum and black pepper. Aged in one-quarter new American and French oak, barrel spices play off the elegant fruit flavors that largely paint around the edges.",87,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2010,8.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"Though only seeing about a quarter new oak—mostly American—it's this aspect that stands out with notes of vanilla and woodspice which overpower notes of cherry, plum and pepper. Still, it's pleasant enough with quite tart fruit flavors and abundant wood accents.",87,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2011,8.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"Coconut, vanilla and spice aromas are at the fore, with the fruit seeming a bit dried out. The black-plum flavors show pleasing depth, with baking-spice flavors speckled throughout. The wood is primary but it's still appealing.",88,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,8.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"Juicy, tart and tightly wound, this pure Malbec has a core of wild, brambly berry and light plum. Nicely managed oak aging (28% new) brings in a lick of smoky caramel, clove and coffee. The flavors fall off a little too quickly on the finish.",88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,8.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"This is a bit lighter than the previous vintage, offering tart red-berry fruit, accented with a note of fresh herb. The chocolaty barrel accents smooth out the midpalate and lead into a pleasant finish.",87,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,17.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"Coming from a mixture of Mirage and Blackrock vineyards, this wine offers aromas of baking spice, vanilla and dark fruit. These are followed by full-bodied black-cherry and spice flavors along with gritty tannins. It dips a bit in the middle and the oak seems a bit heavy, but it still delivers enjoyment.",88,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,17.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"Merlot has long been Waterbrook's strong suit, and this offers the expected seamless blend of cherry/berry fruit, softly polished tannins and toasty barrel flavors. What are missing—at least for the moment—are the grace notes. Give it plenty of breathing time and you begin to detect traces of spice and earth, finishing with a lick of chocolate.",87,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,17.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"There's much to enjoy with this wine's aromas of vanilla, coffee, baking spices, raspberry and green wood. The sweet flavors show cranberry-like tartness and grainy tannins.",87,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,Reserve,Waterbrook

US,"Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish.",87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2011,2.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"Barrel notes of toast, butterscotch and spice are at the fore along with melted butter and peach on this 100% Canyon Vineyard Ranch wine. It's full bodied with a rich, creamy feel, wanting a bit more concentration and acidity to keep it together.",87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,2.0,Reserve,Waterbrook
US,"Strong scents and flavors of oak and spice mask the fruit. It feels a bit flat on the palate, as if heading toward early oxidation. The oak and butterscotch flavors carry through onto the finish. Two bottles tasted.",87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,Reserve,Waterbrook

US,"From Stonetree vineyard, this tightly styled Syrah offers white pepper laced into plummy fruit. There's a pretty floral/violet streak, and also darker notes of tar and smoke, suggesting some coiled power behind the rather light front end.",88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,6.0,Reserve,Waterbrook

US,"While a bit restrained in style, this dry easy-going Riesling offers delicate shades of tangerine and yellow-apple flavor augmented by zesty lime and lemon acidity. Crisp texture and a soft bristle of lime zest lend a vibe to the finish.",87,25.0,New York,New York,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2015,7.0,Reserve,Whitecliff Vineyard
US,"Crisp lemon, lime and mineral tones are restrained on the nose of this dry Riesling, but accumulate in power on the palate. It's a surprisingly peachy, fruit-forward wine, but it maintains deftness of body along with a long, steely finish.",89,25.0,New York,Hudson River Region,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2014,7.0,Reserve,Whitecliff Vineyard
US,"Sultry vanilla, smoke and bergamot notes thread languorously on the nose of this intensely perfumed Chardonnay. The palate is more subdued, showing zesty red apple and lemon anchored by a crisp acidic backbone. It's a touch woody now but could balance out with a few more years of bottle aging.",88,18.0,New York,Hudson River Region,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2014,2.0,Reserve,Whitecliff Vineyard
US,"Pronounced notes of vanilla, spice and toast extend from nose to finish on this creamy, silk-edged Chardonnay. The palate is marked by soft peach, apple and pear flavors lifted by sunny lemon acidity. It's overtly oaky, but elegantly composed.",88,18.0,New York,Hudson River Region,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2013,2.0,Reserve,Whitecliff Vineyard
US,"Layers of charred oak and smoked nuts give this this ripe, creamy Chardonnay a decidedly dark first impression, but the palate is remarkably juicy with soft, sweet honeydew notes. Hints of nut skin against generous cream and butter notes add a savory, bitter elegance to the finish.",88,17.0,New York,New York,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2010,2.0,Reserve,Whitecliff Vineyard
US,"Crisp-tart tangerine, nectarine and pineapple abound on this fruity, forward Chardonnay. While moderate in body and alcohol, it feels plump and silky on the palate and finishes with a touch of lingering warmth. Drink now through 2020.",86,16.0,New York,Hudson River Region,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2016,2.0,Estate Bottled,Whitecliff Vineyard
Canada,"This comes in at 15g/L residual sugar, but it's more than offset with mineral-drenched acidity, so it drinks like a dry wine. Pale lemon in hue, it offers citrus flesh and rind in a young, yeasty, medium-bodied wine. The persistent, crisply-defined finish leaves a pleasing aftertaste of tangerine.",90,24.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,7.0,Reserve,Mission Hill
Canada,"Pinot Noir from Canada can often be quite delicate, but this is a full-bodied, even muscular effort. Toasty and tasty, it puts a pleasant roasted character upon ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. Tannins are substantial, along with some barrel flavors from nine months in French oak.",88,32.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Reserve,Mission Hill
Canada,"Aged 10 months in 25% new American oak, this pleasantly oaky wine delights with its complexity and overall balance. Pineapple, peach and citrus fruits are complemented by notes of coconut (there's that American oak) and hazelnut. Firm acids bring further citrus highlights to the finish.",88,24.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,2.0,Reserve,Mission Hill
US,"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",85,28.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,1.0,Reserve,Silvan Ridge
US,"Forward and fruity, this has California-style fruit and sweet, strawberry candy. The difference is that it fills out the middle with some leafy, herbal flavors, nothing too rough, but enough to add some flavor interest. The finish is fat and buttery, showing the influence of oak aging.",88,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,1.0,Reserve,Silvan Ridge
US,"A curious mix of aromas mix herb, brown sugar and hints of barnyard and leather. The flavors combine all three elements into a wine that may show its best with food.",83,24.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,4.0,Reserve,Silvan Ridge
US,"Scents of raw wood wrap around smoky black cherry fruit. There is a buttery streak, leading into tannins still rough and chewy despite the ample bottle age this wine has been given. The fruit is quickly overwhelmed by the wood.",83,24.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2007,4.0,Reserve,Silvan Ridge
US,"Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish.",84,18.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,25.0,Reserve,Silvan Ridge
US,"I sense some sappy black cherry fruit in here, but it's buried in heavily-toasted barrels and a reductive, plastic flavor that takes over and won't let go. If you give it plenty of extra air time it smoothes out slightly.",85,20.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,6.0,Reserve,Silvan Ridge
US,"This is searingly tart, with more lemon juice than pear fruit, and suggestions of unripe pineapple. On the plus side, it's bright, vivid and strongly acidic.",87,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,18.0,Estate Bottled,Silvan Ridge
US,"Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short.",89,36.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Freedom Hill Vineyard,Silvan Ridge
US,"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured.",93,55.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2015,1.0,Reserve,Point & Line
US,"Just 50 cases exist of this cellar-worthy bottling from a team of restaurant professionals. The nose offers rounded plum pie, clove and inviting vanilla bean, while the palate is framed by chalky tannins that ensure long life, presenting flavors of baked black cherry, peppercorn, graphite, light mulberry and tart pomegranate. Drink 2018–2028.",93,50.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2014,1.0,Reserve,Point & Line
US,"There's a slight, lithe line of butterscotch on the nose of this bottling, with lots of lemon blossoms and Meyer lemon juice overshadowing the buttery aspect. The palate is tart in green apple and Anjou pear flavors, followed by honeydew and white peach.",90,40.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Matt Kettmann,2015,2.0,Sierra Madre Vineyard,Point & Line
US,"A huge step up from the previous vintage, this ripe, round and wonderfully fruity effort is a juicy, mineral-soaked bottle of joy. Luscious cherry fruit is topped with a dollop of butterscotch.",92,48.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2010,1.0,Reserve,Rex Hill
US,"Very little of this reserve was produced in 2011. A blend from five vineyards, it spent 10 months in 43% new oak. Firm and a bit steely, it has tight dark fruits anchored in a streak of earth and iron. Give it a few more years in the bottle, or decant if drinking it soon.",89,52.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,1.0,Reserve,Rex Hill
US,"Organically grown and selected from a mix of specific vineyard blocks, Rex Hill's reserve is rather light in 2007, with tannins that are a bit out of proportion to the fruit. It's a carefully controlled effort, but thin and dilute, with strawberry/watermelon fruit and some tomato leaf creeping into the finish.",87,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2007,1.0,Reserve,Rex Hill
US,"A full percentage lower in alcohol than the 2012, this nonetheless is amply concentrated, with abundant brambly berry, cherry and blue plum. A wash of chocolate comes over the tannins as the wine finishes with a dusting of cinnamon.",91,52.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,1.0,Reserve,Rex Hill
US,"Supple, almost silky in the mouth, this slips into lush flavors of mocha truffle, with a core of raspberry fruit. It remains a bit tight through the finish, with light streaks of coffee and fresh herb. Delicious already, it seems destined to improve further with a bit more bottle age. Drink now through 2025.",92,58.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Reserve,Rex Hill
US,"The recent vintages of Rex Hill Pinots tend to be big, ripe wines, at times just on the border of raisiny, with fleshy, effusive fruit flavors matched to plenty of toasty oak. Despite the high alcohol, these are enjoyable and even seductive wines. The red fruit flavors are sharp and angular, with spicy tobacco and pepper highlights.",89,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,1.0,Reserve,Rex Hill
US,"The old vine designation, though unregulated, is usually reserved for plantings at least a quarter century old. Though the first sniff suggests a wine that has been over-oaked, such is not the case. It has the concentration and fruit power—layers of citrus and stone fruit flavors—along with the depth and texture that older vines bring, to more than support the generous new oak.",90,78.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2009,2.0,Old Vine,Rex Hill
US,"Hooray for Shea—a shining star in this difficult vintage. Give it a good sniff and note the wood smoke, cedar and bacon scents rising from the glass. Fruit flavors tumble after, a complex mix of fig, berry and black cherry, with a streak of cola. It's lively and lingering—drink now or cellar until 2024.",91,58.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Rex Hill
US,"Though the listed alcohol tops 15%, this remains a fruity and rather simple wine, with dominating flavors of raspberry and cherry cola. As good as it is, this could use a bit more muscle.",88,58.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2009,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Rex Hill
US,"This pulls off the neat trick of being both light and dense, with fruit running the gamut from strawberry to cherry to cassis. Deeply concentrated, and with lovely purity and length, this is delicious now but will surely drink even better in a few years. Drink 2018 through 2028.",93,58.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Rex Hill
US,"The Shea Vineyard, replanted during the 1990s due to phylloxera, is returning to its old form. Round and fresh fruit flavors, lightly toasty, and showing a dusting of powdered sugar, craft a fruity wine with a raspberry pastry character. Lovely for near-term enjoyment.",89,65.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Rex Hill

It's balanced and nicely textured, with a dollop of moist earth accenting the tannins.",88,58.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2010,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Rex Hill
US,"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special. Red berries, blood orange, a touch of Grand Marnier, impressive body and spicy highlights all combine in a darn near irresistible rosé with the power to be a four season wine.",91,24.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2015,9.0,Pinot Noir,Rex Hill

US,"Fruity in black plum and ripe raspberry, it's structured and weighty on the palate, dark and brambly with firm, substantial tannins.

Australia,"Usually one of Yarra's top Pinots, the 2006 YS Reserve is a medium-bodied, rounded wine with extremely soft tannic structure. The aromas hint at brown sugar, coffee and cola, with flavors of roasted root vegetables and a touch of mushroom. Supple and silky on the finish. Drink now.",88,60.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Joe Czerwinski,2006,1.0,Reserve,Yering Station

Drink it now and over the next several years. Imported by Epic Wines.",91,45.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Joe Czerwinski,2005,1.0,Reserve,Yering Station
Australia,"Like all of the Yering Station Reserves, this one shows a healthy whack of new oak, but there's plenty of ripe cherry fruit to support the vanilla and cedar nuances. It's medium bodied, plump yet suave, with a long finish that echoes vanilla and spice. Drink now–2019.",90,65.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Joe Czerwinski,2010,1.0,Reserve,Yering Station
Australia,"Assertively toasty and nutty, this is barrel-fermented in new oak, but in 500-liter puncheons, not the smaller barriques, so that the wood doesn't overwhelm. Peach, vanilla and citrus flavors completely fill the mouth, yet remain fresh and vibrant on the finish. Drink now–2012. Imported by Epic Wines.",91,45.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Joe Czerwinski,2005,2.0,Reserve,Yering Station

US,"Crisp and clean lines of tart apricot, nectarine, Gala apple and honeysuckle ride a steely frame that characterizes the nose of this wine. Minerality shows first on the sip, but then the wine becomes ripe with apple, pear and peach flavors. A green-apple-rind tartness arises on the finish.",86,14.0,California,Monterey County,Matt Kettmann,2015,2.0,Reserve,Angeline

US,"This big-boned Cabernet tastes rich, complex and inviting. It combines cinnamon and cedar aromas, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors and a firm, tannic texture that will love a grilled lamb chop or similar flavorful fare.

US,"From the winery that first popularized Petite Sirah in California, this vintage has vivid black-pepper aromas and a deep, inky color. Rich and concentrated flavors suggest pomegranate juice, blackberries and clove. Lavish and layered tannins give the texture an almost thick viscosity that coats the mouth for a lasting impression.",91,40.0,California,Livermore Valley,Jim Gordon,2010,29.0,Reserve,Concannon
US,"A very dark color and extremely concentrated fruit flavors give this dry and firmly tannic wine a lot of substance. It feels tightly wound, and will need time for the tannins to soften and let the tight, tart blackberry and bitter-chocolate flavors open up for more enjoyment. Known to age well for decades, this Concannon classic will be best from 2022.",92,42.0,California,Livermore Valley,Jim Gordon,2013,29.0,Reserve,Concannon
US,"This big and brawny bottling from the first winery to popularize the varietal is full bodied and appropriately tannic while offering meaty, smoky, savory aromas and flavors.

US,"Juicy blackberry and boysenberry flavors fill out this deeply colored, bold-tasting, full-bodied but not oaky wine. More fruit nuances and concentration develop with each sip, and the richly tannic texture coats the sides of the mouth, propelling the ripe fruit through the finish. It's a great way to enjoy this Bordeaux grape variety bottled on its own instead of in a blend, as usual.",91,32.0,California,Livermore Valley,Jim Gordon,2013,43.0,Reserve,Concannon
US,"Aromatically unctuous and inviting, this rich, thick Petit Verdot, one of Concannon's smaller bottlings, is mouthfilling in chocolate, tobacco and dark plum, long-lasting through the midpalate and finish. Soft, with moderate tannins, it's a big wine with structure that'll age or pair with serious meat or game now.",89,30.0,California,Livermore Valley,Virginie Boone,2010,43.0,Reserve,Concannon
US,"A big but not-too-tannic Petit Verdot, this is juicy and structured with red fruit and a light layer of spice. Tending toward black licorice and dark chocolate, it could use a splash of something to brighten it up. But it's otherwise a bottle worth trying if you're curious to try a varietal Petit Verdot.",86,30.0,California,Livermore Valley,Virginie Boone,2009,43.0,Reserve,Concannon
US,"This wine is smooth and refreshing, showing fresh raspberry and strawberry flavors and a texture that's mouthfilling but nicely crisp.

US,"This barrel-fermented wine reflects the modest ripeness that marked the 2010 vintage. Scents of almond paste, orange peel, citrus, melon and pear intertwine, and the wine's flavors carry light suggestions of them all, along with a touch of caramel. It's drinking well right now, so why wait?",88,28.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,Reserve,Stoller

US,"This bone-dry high-acid wine puts flavors of grapefruit flesh and rind front and center. It's a no-fuss summer sipper, perhaps not quite as rich as previous vintages, or maybe just exceptionally young. It's tangy, fresh and focused.",88,25.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Paul Gregutt,2016,9.0,Pinot Noir,Stoller

US,"A 100% varietal wine, this offers tremendous quality for the price, a well-crafted showcase for currant, cedar and bark that remains savory at its core.

US,"This wine, from a label named after one of the state's wine pioneers, is Chardonnay in the traditional California style—done exceedingly well.

US,"An ultrapure nose and tons of polish and precision define this tasty reserve-style blend of several vineyards. Pretty much an easy-drinker, with an undercurrent of sweet cherries and vanilla.

US,"A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base.

Expressive and detailed.",91,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,1.0,Freedom Hill Vineyard,Panther Creek

US,"The tart berry fruit flavors seem etched in place, as they are framed with sleek tannins, bright acidity and a sliver of steel.

Argentina,"Fresh and reasonably fruity on the nose, but it's also slightly gritty and tough. Shows medium weight and intensity in the mouth, with a medicinal red-berry flavor accented by spice and herb notes.

Argentina,"Asphalt and gaseous aromas take a while to settle, but after they do, leather and scratchy blackberry scents surface. It feels big and brawny, with max extraction. It tastes masculine but salty, with bitter chocolate and peppery accents. Bulky for $11 wine.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,6.0,Reserve,Trivento
Argentina,"While this opens with harmless aromas of lychee and tropical fruits, the palate sizzles with sharp citric acidity. Flavors of pithy grapefruit and tangerine finish grabby, tart and aggressive.

US,"These vines date back to the mid-1970s and were originally planted by Dick Erath. This is their final vintage, as they've been removed. As a last hurrah it's a fine one, an intriguing melding of floral, mint and citrus components. With 13g/L residual sugar, it's just slightly off dry, with good palate penetration and superior length.",90,25.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Paul Gregutt,2014,7.0,Old Vine,WildAire
US,"Many of Oregon's best winemakers are scrambling to acquire Shea grapes. This small-scale producer does a fine job. Its Shea designate is a captivating wine loaded with blueberry, blue plum, black raspberry and a touch of violets. One-third new French oak brings a vein of chocolate. The balance is impeccable. Drink this with enjoyment immediately, or cellar it through 2025.",94,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Shea Vineyard,WildAire
US,"This is an interesting bottle from sourced fruit (rather than estate-grown). Ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit is matched to ripe tannins; the wine is dark, almost sultry, and the flavors flow seamlessly across the palate. There is a spicy lift and a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) that concludes the presentation.",88,55.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,1.0,Reserve,Methven Family Vineyards
US,"A dark and smoky wine, with that charred, smoky note most evident in the nose. Streaks of vanilla and black tea run through the core flavors. Substantial, perhaps enough to match to a thick steak.",86,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,1.0,Reserve,Methven Family Vineyards
US,"Soft and lightly oaky, this barrel-fermented wine has a lightly honeyed element, perhaps an indication of botrytis. The wine should be consumed young, as it is already showing signs of age in both color and mouthfeel.",86,21.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,18.0,Barrel Fermented,Methven Family Vineyards
US,"Spindrift's reserve bottling does not seem substantially different from its regular 2005 Pinot, except that it extends its flavors through a much longer and smoother finish. Bright red fruit flavors mix raspberry and blueberry with milk chocolate. An impression of spun sugar wraps up the finish.",88,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,1.0,Reserve,Spindrift Cellars
US,"The year 2014 was a fine vintage for reserve-level wines, and this one brings concentrated cherry-berry fruit into a generous midpalate. Those big forward fruit flavors wrap through the finish, which is lightly touched, though not seriously impacted, with a glue-like note.",89,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Reserve,Spindrift Cellars
US,"For a reserve from what is generally acclaimed as a stellar vintage in the Willamette Valley, this wine seems thin and watery. Watermelon and raspberry fruit leads into an acidic, one-dimensional finish.",85,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,1.0,Reserve,Spindrift Cellars
US,"This medium-bodied wine is already drinking optimally, with a core of red fruit streaked with cola, earth, graphite and citrus notes. Only four barrels were produced.",89,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Barrel Select,Spindrift Cellars
US,"The Barrel Select offers a bit more concentration than the winery's regular Pinot, with meatier tannins and highlights of spice and coffee grounds. It's soundly made and already drinks well in a forward, accessible style.",88,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Barrel Select,Spindrift Cellars
US,"Pale salmon in color, but quite robust in flavor and alcohol, this brings concentrated flavors of watermelon and raspberries, with all the freshness of the newest vintage. It's bright and focused, the very picture of what is most exciting about these seasonal Northwest rosés.",90,16.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2016,1.0,Rosé of,Spindrift Cellars
US,"Tart, bracing and a bit leesy, this has hints of rhubarb, jicama and starchy white vegetables. It's not vegetal in a green sense, just quite dry and a bit slender.",86,16.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,1.0,Rosé,Spindrift Cellars
US,"This tight, rather austere Syrah shows cool- climate flavors; it's hard and herbal, earthy and tannic, but there is a lot going on. It's not a fruit-driven wine, rather it has the earthy, composty complexity of a Cayuse Syrah, though less concentrated. Definitely a wine worth chasing.",89,32.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Paul Gregutt,2006,6.0,Seven Hills Vineyard,Spindrift Cellars
US,"This shows excellent focus and spice in the nose, with scents of cardamom and clove reminiscent of a good Mendocino Pinot. Plenty of flavor up front, but the wine loses it in the middle palate. It finishes with a soft, spicy, slightly banana flavor, a bit out of balance.",87,18.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,1999,1.0,Reserve,Bridgeview
US,"Beets, mint and cola mark the aromas of this robust offering from the southern part of the state. It’s rich and corpulent—almost Port-like in its dimensions—and although it lacks a bit of elegance, it certainly possesses plenty of mouth-filling flavor.",87,20.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Joe Czerwinski,1998,1.0,Reserve,Bridgeview
US,"This is the first reserve for Bridgeview. It's a block selection, treated the same as their regular bottling; i.e., all stainless, no malolactic. That said, it has an extra dimension, good texture, more elegance and lovely fruit.",89,16.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2000,18.0,Reserve,Bridgeview
US,"Extended time in all new French oak barrels give this wine a heartier feel than it might otherwise have, swirls of oaky caramel and toast most prominent on the nose and initial palate. A richness of color also stands out, while velvety tannins and red fruit complete the experience. Letting the wine open helps temper its size, revealing a measured level of refinement.",90,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2011,1.0,Reserve,En Garde
US,"With a concentrated bouquet of black cherry and leathery earth, this straddles the richness of California fruit with an Old World layering of savory sumptuousness. Built with structure and subtle acidity, it is meant to be enjoyed at the table, a pork tenderloin or mushroom quiche among the pairing possibilities.",90,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2010,1.0,Reserve,En Garde
US,"This is a young, wild and dense wine, intense in oak and strong-willed red cherry and strawberry fruit. Full-bodied and still smoothing out its rough edges, the big tannin structure should allow a length of aging through 2020.",90,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,1.0,Reserve,En Garde
US,"This is a sultry, leathery and sinewy wine, dark in tannin and oak and a full-bodied ripeness of dense fruit that delves into savory Asian spice. Powerful, it combines a wealth of clones to good effect, aging for 17 months in new French oak, 83% of it new.",91,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Reserve,En Garde
US,"A mountain of a mountain-grown Cabernet, this is hearty and generous in cherry-vanilla-laden tannins and a leathery grip on the palate. Herbal notes intermix with anise and soy sauce, a taste of black tea and ripe black, brambly fruit upfront. Give the wine time and air to soften.",91,98.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Virginie Boone,2008,4.0,Reserve,En Garde
US,"This exotic Cabernet Sauvignon, which is aged entirely in new French oak, needs time to develop. A savory edge of forest floor and cranberry drive the palate, while notes of pencil shavings, cedar and garrigue add depth. The palate is lifted in acidity, with tightly gripped tannins on the finish. Cellar through 2019.",94,98.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Virginie Boone,2009,4.0,Reserve,En Garde
US,"This wine's dried flower and dark chocolate aromas emerge in the glass, with brambly berry notes in tow. A well-structured effort, it tastes of tart raspberry and cherry fruit with darker streaks of anise and espresso. The tannins, though proportionate, are a touch green.",89,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Reserve,Walnut City WineWorks
US,"Compared with the the regular bottling, this reserve has a touch more concentration to the black cherry fruit. It pays for it with some hard, rather stemmy tannins that can turn bitter. Give this some extra time to breathe after being opened.",87,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Reserve,Walnut City WineWorks
US,"A pleasant, though generic wine, this brings light touches of apple, pear and peach, underscored with moderate acidity. Though barrel fermented, it seems more in line with most stainless steel Chardonnays, with hints of herb throughout.",87,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,2.0,Reserve,Walnut City WineWorks
US,"Plenty of acid underscores rich flavors of pineapple, Meyer lemon and lemon curd. The wine dives deeply into the palate and lingers, with crisp highlights of citrus rind and a long, smooth finish.",90,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,2.0,Reserve,Walnut City WineWorks
US,"Pretty and scented with watermelon and strawberry, this rosé turns tart in the mouth, tasting of rhubarb and sour berry. It's fresh and refreshing, especially drunk cold in hot weather with a picnic spread.",86,16.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,1.0,Rosé of,Walnut City WineWorks
US,"Though 2014 is a fine, accessible vintage for many Oregon Pinots, this one is rather stubbornly shut down. At first it shows stem and herb flavors, along with chewy tannins. With hours of breathing time, the fruit emerges, a mix of rhubarb, cherry and a dash of cola.",89,50.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Reserve,Aubichon Cellars
US,"The reserve bottling shows more phenolic bite than the easy-drinking regular release. There are tight deep streaks of stem and earth, along with scents of cola and sassafras, and stiff tannins framing tight cherry fruit. This is the one to tuck away for a couple more years while drinking the regular Willamette Valley bottling.",91,50.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2015,1.0,Reserve,Aubichon Cellars
US,"This has well-integrated herb and stem components around spicy red fruits. It punches through into a tight, well-built finish, with smooth, clean tannins. Another couple of years in bottle may help to fill it out.",90,50.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,1.0,Reserve,Aubichon Cellars
US,"The reserve is a barrel selection and demonstrates its special status with pretty floral topnotes suggesting rose petals and body soap. In the mouth it's a substantial wine with juicy red fruits, excellent texture and impressive length. A lick of milk chocolate puts the frosting on the finish.",92,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,1.0,Reserve,Aubichon Cellars
US,"This shows some extra concentration in its plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel has a pleasing texture, and the streaks of herb and cola are nicely integrated. As with many of the wines of this vintage, it's forward and fruit-driven and ready for immediate enjoyment.",92,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Reserve,Aubichon Cellars
US,"Quite distinct from the winery's regular Pinot Gris, this is oak fermented and barrel aged on the lees for 16 months. The hock bottle suggests an Alsatian model, the extended barrel time softening the sharp acidity. There's a light suggestion of wood flavor, not toast but neutral wood, and the fruit is damped down. However, with extra aeration this wine springs to life, with complex highlights of wood, herb and stone.",91,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,18.0,Reserve,Aubichon Cellars
US,This barrel-fermented wine has an aggressive toasty aroma that carries over into the flavors. Its ripe apple and buttered toast notes lead to a finish accented with coconut. A Chardonnay lover's Pinot Gris.,90,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2015,18.0,Reserve,Aubichon Cellars

There's a charred-stave character that adds vanilla and a tinge of mocha as well. Drink now.",85,13.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,Joe Czerwinski,2013,1.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"A very good showing for this wine, which should be on all value-conscious shoppers' lists. Mint accents black cherry and cassis fruit enriched by some chocolaty notes. Tannins are plentiful but ripe, giving it the necessary heft to stand up to grilled steak.",88,13.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2004,4.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"More austere and lighter in weight than other Australian Cabernets in this price range, perhaps reflecting its coolish Coonawarra origins. Herb and cherry notes finish dusty and crisp. Might surprise in a year or two.",85,13.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,Joe Czerwinski,2009,4.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"Each Jacob's Creek Reserve wine is now sourced from a specific region, and this Chardonnay shows solid improvement as a result.

Drink it over the next 6–9 months.",89,13.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,Joe Czerwinski,2009,2.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"JC is making an effort to upgrade its Reserve range, and this is a good example, offering peach and pineapple flavors framed by vanilla, butter and toast. It's all barrel-fermented, impressive at this production level (25,000 cases) and price point.",87,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2006,2.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"So putting “Reserve” on a $13 bottle of wine might seem like a stretch, but the fact is what's in the bottle is very good. It's full bodied, creamy and lushly textured, with an intriguing herbal tang to the black cherry fruit, hints of vanilla and a softly dusty finish. Drink now–2018.",89,13.0,South Australia,Barossa,Joe Czerwinski,2013,24.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"Pretty impressive for the price, offering mint and cedar aromas followed by flavors of black cherry. There's also a sturdy core of savory elements, like roasted meat and coffee. The wine is full bodied and velvety in texture, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now and over the next few years.",88,13.0,South Australia,Barossa,Joe Czerwinski,2010,24.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"Reminiscent of some Paso Robles red wines, this superripe Shiraz has some sweetly grassy or alfalfa-like aromas to go alongside blackberry and chocolate flavors that lean toward coffee and caramel on the finish. It's round in the mouth, the tannins ultrasoft; drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",85,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2004,24.0,Reserve,Jacob's Creek
Australia,"You could do a lot worse at the U.S. Open than to sip a glass of this.

France,"Oaky notes of buttered toast, dried apple slices and baked peach are upfront in the bouquet of this wine. The palate is similarly rich and round, but with ample acidity to keep it from falling completely flat. Flavors of orange creamsicle and spiced apple linger on the close.",84,10.0,France Other,Vin de France,Lauren Buzzeo,2014,2.0,Reserve,Phantom Bay

US,"Lively and lush, this is lip-smacking good juice. It's dense with apple, peach and melon fruit flavors that penetrate deeply, buoyed by juicy acidity.

US,"Hearty aromas of plum and dried black cherries are bolstered by warm cedar tones, a touch of tar, crushed peppercorns and chopped garden herbs. The palate is complex, with lots of acidity and peppery spice, showing flavors of oregano and marjoram on a base of plum fruit. It's dense with flavors but medium in body, and very lively.",92,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2012,4.0,Reserve,Edna Valley Vineyard
US,"Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors.",90,35.0,California,Edna Valley,Matt Kettmann,2013,2.0,Reserve,Edna Valley Vineyard

US,"This bottling spent 20 months in French oak (30% new), and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards.

Drink now through 2020.",92,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Reserve,Ponzi
US,"A gorgeous wine, lush and refined from the first sniff to the last swallow. Rose petals, cotton candy, chocolate-covered cherries—it's a date in a bottle. As the wine rolls across the palate it seems to gain depth and detail, while keeping the exceptionally pretty fruit flavors front and center. Silky and lightly spicy, with cinnamon, toast, mocha and tobacco highlights.",95,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,1.0,Reserve,Ponzi
US,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more.

Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",89,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,2.0,Reserve,Ponzi
US,"If you like a bigger, broader style, with plenty of toast and buttery goodness, this is the one for you. It spent a year in one-quarter new barrels, another eight months in neutral oak.

US,"Although 2013 may have been a difficult vintage, for some winemakers it resulted in immaculate wines with impeccable precision and focus.

Argentina,"Earthy and showing clay, milk chocolate, baked cherry and mocha aromas and flavors, and while the wine feels fairly smooth it doesn't do much but lay there on the palate. Kind of heavy, amorphous and seemingly fading, and overall it's a junior version of Salentein's dying Primum Pinot from 2004.",83,21.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2004,1.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"Gamy aromas lead to a sinewy, lean palate. This funky Cabernet tastes of creamy oak, plum and green herbs. It finishes a bit weedy, with savory offsets.",86,19.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine.",87,20.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2004,4.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha.

Argentina,"Lush, forward and complete, with a full mix of sweet and spicy aromas leading to bright berry flavors accented by licorice and vanilla from well-managed oak.

Argentina,"Warm dark fruit aromas of blueberry are accented by rubber and earth. The palate is deep and racy, with no dead weight and good flavors of berry, cassis, spice and chocolate. Bright in feel, focused and just oaky and dry enough to not be jammy and soft. 35,000 cases made.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"Aromas of herbs and desert brush blend with raisiny berry scents. This feels grabby and tannic, while jammy, herbal berry flavors flatten out with airing. A loamy tasting finish loses some intensity and spirit as this settles.",89,19.0,Mendoza Province,Valle de Uco,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"Oily citrus aromas are pungent on the nose. This is chunky but braced by firm acidity. Waxy, warm, oaky flavors of caramel and baked apple finish with punchy citric acidity and an oak-based touch of butterscotch.",87,19.0,Mendoza Province,Valle de Uco,Michael Schachner,2013,2.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"Juniper and onion aromas are not inviting, and there's little fruit to back them up. The mouthfeel is oily, while flavors of briny citrus lead to a pickled-tasting finish. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",82,20.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2011,2.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"White fruit aromas are as expected and clean, with no faux oak, weight or interference. The palate is round but nicely acidic, with cutting texture and sweet, lightly creamy flavors of sweet peach, apple and butter. Turns slightly oaky late, with butterscotch and spice.",87,19.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2010,2.0,Reserve,Salentein
Argentina,"Nutty aromas of almond skins and walnut aren't terribly fruity but show some mineral cut. The wine is punchy but standard in feel, with a mix of citrus and melon flavors. The finish tastes nutty and a bit briny.",85,19.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2012,2.0,Reserve,Salentein
US,"A finesse style, elegant and soft. Smooth, fruit forward, and perfectly balanced. Nothing out of proportion, no hint of stem or harsh or bitter tannins. There is a lovely purity of fruit, mixed red fruits, plum and cherry. A mere hint of chocolate shavings, but the oak is minimal, perhaps too minimal.",90,35.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,1999,1.0,Reserve,King Estate
US,"This is much creamier, with much more leesy flavor than the regular bottling, but not as much ripe fruit (perhaps because it is from a different vintage). Various flavors of nuts, honey, spice and light tropical fruit mingle in a well balanced finish.",89,15.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,1997,2.0,Reserve,King Estate
US,"This is a benchmark rendition of Pinot Gris. The flavors are fruit driven, with lime, apple and pear notes combining on the smooth, relatively soft midpalate. This is a consistent wine, even with its production level of 100,000 cases.",88,17.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2011,18.0,Signature,King Estate
US,"Spicy scents introduce a fresh and fleshy pear-flavored Pinot Gris, with a crisp underpinning of wet stone and medium acids. Citrus peel, light orange and pineapple weave into the midpalate, and the wine fills the mouth without being heavy.",88,17.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2009,18.0,Signature,King Estate
US,"This is a thickly concentrated and powerfully full-bodied wine, spicy in clove and cinnamon as well as a lingering note of cola. The fruit leans into blackberry and black cherry, with a pronounced weedy, herbal undertone.",88,55.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Reserve,Acacia
US,"This wine is bold and brawny, defined by big, oaky tannin and concentrated weight. Fresh black cherry develops a candied quality in the glass, while an earthy undercurrent of minty forest adds complexity.",88,50.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Reserve,Acacia
US,"From great farmers and a great site, this wine somehow never comes fully to life, offering a muted taste of cherry and strawberry around minty dollops of earth and dried herb.",86,69.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Acacia
US,"Nutty and reminiscent of lemon oil, this wine also offers a full-bodied richness of apple and caramel, transforming into peach and vanilla bean flavor as it opens.",88,46.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Acacia
US,"Opulently dense, this wine opens nicely in orange blossom and caramel apple, followed by a palate that's somewhat incomplete in fruit-flavor follow-up. Concentrated and full bodied, it packs a powerful punch, ending in oak.",86,45.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Acacia
US,"Toasted oak and caramel apple mark the entry of this wine, from a coveted and steady source of Carneros fruit. Lush and hedonistic in Golden Delicious apple and pear, it retains a core of minerality throughout, finishing clean and bright.",93,45.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2012,2.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Acacia
US,"Ripe plums and plump Bing cherries gain complexity from chaparral scrub and roasted meats in the background. The palate is rounded with Mission figs and violets, enhanced by a sharp acidity and noticeable tannic grip.",85,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2012,1.0,Reserve,Bridlewood
US,"Dark strawberry mixes with allspice, incense and a touch of smoke on this wine's nose. Purple-flower flavors of lavender and violet mix with black raspberry, dried sage, ginger and black tea, all wrapped up in tart plum-peel tension.",90,50.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2014,1.0,Reserve,Bridlewood
US,"Vanilla, cherry, cedar, pipe smoke and violet extracts swirl into a rather amazing nose on this wine from the Gallo-owned producer. The black cherry-dominated palate is lifted by baking soda minerality, and the tannins are present but not intrusive.",89,50.0,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Matt Kettmann,2012,4.0,Reserve,Bridlewood
US,"Very inviting, incredibly rich aromas of butterscotch, crème brûlée, peach custard, lemon curds, honeysuckle and caramelized banana show on this wine's thick nose. The palate offers orange peels cooked in a buttery sauce, marshmallows and marzipan.",88,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2013,2.0,Reserve,Bridlewood
US,"Rich without being heavy, this wine offers bright cherry and strawberry, followed by pretty floral components and just a tiny dose of cinnamon. Balanced and not overdone in oak, it's enjoyable and ready for the table.",87,50.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2011,1.0,Reserve,Ca' Momi
US,"Dusty tannins make for a soft texture in this wine that's subtle in dried fruit, Christmas spice, chocolate and clove. It delivers flavor and complexity without attitude, a savory expression of the grape from a relatively cool climate.",90,44.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2013,17.0,Reserve,Ca' Momi
US,"A healthy portion of barrel influence is felt in this reserve wine, amid medium acidity.

US,"Seductive aromas of raspberries, sandalwood, graphite and a pinch of allspice entertain the nose on this wine. The spiced wood character carries to the palate, where dried strawberries and pomegranate add riper fruit elements.",89,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2013,1.0,Reserve,MacMurray Estate Vineyards
US,"Full bodied and richly layered, this wine opens aromatically with delicate rose petal, cranberry and rhubarb, which all continue on the palate. Tart and herbal, this holds additional earthiness at its core, defined by notes of forest floor and black tea.",90,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Reserve,MacMurray Estate Vineyards
US,"Light in color and silky in texture, this earthy wine offers overtones of cinnamon, dark cherry, raspberry and clove.

US,"This is a juicy, earthy and expansive wine, with highlights of rose petal and wild strawberry. Pretty and ethereal, it offers body without an abundance of weight, the oak and tannin both integrated well.",91,43.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2015,1.0,Reserve,MacMurray Estate Vineyards
US,"Beguiling streaks of red cherry surround a light, spicy, food-friendly core that's well balanced and integrated, the oak and tannin elegantly respectful of the red fruit. It offers medium weight amid the smoothness.",90,27.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,1.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,Chocolate-covered strawberry meets rich brown sugar and cola notes in this medium-bodied wine that's moderately structured and round. It finishes in a plume of subtle smoky oak.,86,27.0,California,Alexander Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,4.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers

US,"Rich in plum, black cherry and blackberry, this wine is subtle in cinnamon and dried herb, with additional embellishments of leather and earth. Soft and subdued, it's approachable and versatile.",87,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,17.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,"A creamy, full-bodied expression of the variety, this conveys a fruit basket of apple, pear and kiwi while also offering a lilt of New World grassiness and herb.",87,17.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,12.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,"Stony lemon and a twist or two of grass dot zesty acidity in this clean, crisp and focused white, sure to be a pleasurable quaffer.",88,17.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2015,12.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,This is a simple representation of the variety: medium in acidity and weight and a roundness of appropriate apple and pear that finishes flat.,84,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,"Dominant oak notes impact this wine in both taste and aroma, providing caramel- and tropical vanilla-like sweetness. It offers anise and pineapple flavors within its light-bodied frame.",85,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2015,2.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,"Rich, tannic and brambly, a juiciness of blackberry jam forms the substantive core of this wine, made in larger quantities for larger distribution. The finish is leathery and well integrated in oak.",86,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,13.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,"Sweet red cherry, strawberry and smoky charred oak figure most prominently in this robust, full-bodied wine, which opens in a yeasty, baked bread note, and which comes across as somewhat undeveloped.",83,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,13.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
US,"Brawny and brooding, this rich wine shows a density of flavor and personality. Plum, strawberry and leathery black pepper form its core.",87,20.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Virginie Boone,2015,13.0,Reserve,Frei Brothers
Argentina,"Very light in color and body, with citric and chewing gum aromas along with a spot of caramel. The palate is lean, jumpy and fresh, with tart cherry and plum skin flavors. Borders on sour but doesn't quite go that far. Lean Pinot any way you slice it.",84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,1.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Dry red fruit and tomato notes define the nose on this light-colored Pinot. Flavors of earthy cherry and spice get buried under buttery oak, which carries through onto the finish.",82,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,1.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Earthy leathery berry and briar patch aromas are a touch tomatoey. This feels sturdy, but that's really all you can say about the mouthfeel. Peppery spicy red-berry flavors are a bit grassy on the finish.",86,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,4.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Stewed, saucy aromas of grassy tomato and herbal berry fruits are foxy. This feels cutting and rough, while minty green-berry flavors come with a note of animal fur.",83,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Herbal, stalky aromas surround scents of asphalt and animal hide as well as generic berry notes. A lively palate holds flavors of herbal, leafy plum, raw wood and funk, while the finish is tangy in feel, with flavors of dry oak and hints of green.",84,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"This smells far better than it feels or tastes. The nose offers black fruit and graham cracker notes, but the palate is sharp and punchy, with sour plum and rhubarb flavors that finish herbal and briny.",81,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Orange blossom and other common white fruit aromas make for a standard, generic type of bouquet. The palate is regular in feel and weight, with shy flavors of melon and apple. Entirely middle of the road in aromas, body, feel and flavors.",84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,2.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,2.0,Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"This smells heavily charred, like a blend of burnt leaf, charcoal-grilled hamburger and funky, roasted berry. The palate feels rough and bumpy, while the flavor profile is herbal to an extreme. Finishes green and soupy.",82,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Grand Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"A rough, pinchy nose with leather and funk is no way to begin. The palate stays hard and spiky, with burnt, rustic, murky flavors. Roasted and mossy on the finish, and not very good overall.",80,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Grand Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"A blend of charred oak and violets lead the bouquet, which also offers some floral berry. The palate is lifted, medium-weight and juicy, with boysenberry and cherry flavors. Very nice if you like a floral Malbec with bright berry fruit as opposed to something dark, meaty and oaky.",88,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Grand Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Plum and berry aromas are floral and suggestive of perfumed soap. This has a friendly, easy mouthfeel and limited but good flavors of spiced plum and raspberry. A mild, low-tannin finish leaves a peppery aftertaste.",88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Grand Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Lightly stewed, tomatoey aromas belie how angular and acidic this Malbec is. Sharp is the word that best describes the mouthfeel, while tart plum and currant flavors finish with drawing acidity.",82,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Grand Reserve,Cruz Alta
Argentina,"Good for Argentine Chard but not worth the price. It starts with mellow peach and apricot aromas, which are followed by melon, papaya and banana flavors. Easygoing in terms of feel, with a creamy, sweet finish. A typical South American tropical Chardonnay.",85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,2.0,Grand Reserve,Cruz Alta
US,"This offers a well-defined balance between ripe, juicy cherry fruit and a seductive earthiness that keeps every sip intriguing. Structured and medium in weight, it's a fine choice for the table, the spiciness on the back palate particularly well-honed and worth recognition.",94,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,1.0,Reserve,Fritz
US,"This mild-mannered wine offers moderate acidity, a stony texture and Gravenstein apple and lemon highlights. Medium bodied, it finishes clean and simple.",87,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2015,2.0,Reserve,Fritz
US,"This wine has tart acidity that jumps from the glass, a taste of wet stone and lemon zest that's persistent through the midpalate. Along the way, a hint of grass, gooseberry and peach fuzz ride the waves of textured crispness.",86,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Virginie Boone,2015,12.0,Estate Grown,Fritz
US,"Almost entirely fermented in stainless steel, it has unquestionable acidity captured in the bottle, without a sacrifice of ripe, juicy peach fruit. Lemongrass lingers on the tail end.",89,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,12.0,Estate Grown,Fritz
US,"Oaky bacon and barbecue smoke make for a burly wine-drinking experience in this full-bodied, expressive and somewhat heavy offering from the Dry Creek winery's estate.",85,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,13.0,Estate Grown,Fritz
US,"This is a soft, creamy Chardonnay that's reminiscent of baked apples loaded with cinnamon and perked up with a few curls of orange zest. Finishes long, with creamy vanilla supported by orange echoes. —J.C.",88,22.0,California,Russian River Valley,Joe Czerwinski,2000,2.0,Dutton Ranch,Fritz
US,"Sweet-leaning aromas of black cherry, cola and anise show on the nose of this appellation blend. The flavors are much more subtle, with touches of cherry, cranberry and gravel.",85,35.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2015,1.0,Reserve,Firestone
US,"Nearing greenish-yellow in the glass, this wine offers lemon curd, a touch of oak and a flash of white peach on the nose. Golden apple and iodine flavors show on the palate, which proves more bitter and sour than ripe.",86,27.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Matt Kettmann,2013,2.0,Reserve,Firestone
US,"Bright acidity translates to the aromas in this bottling: laser-sharp lime zest, squeezed grapefruit, dewy grass and wet gravel. Those scents grow riper as the wine warms, while the palate seems sweeter—more lime candy than fresh lime. It finishes tart, with a wet metal freshness.",87,20.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Matt Kettmann,2015,12.0,Barrel Select,Firestone
US,"White peach, hints of smoke, yellow pear and squeezed lemon show on the rounded nose of this wine. It's softer in style on the palate, with kumquat cream, poached apple and pear, white flowers but also a sharper herbal backbone of dill and fennel.",87,20.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Matt Kettmann,2014,12.0,Barrel Select,Firestone
US,"Spicy acidity wraps around a lengthy and intense experience of full-bodied concentration and power in this well-made wine. Forest pine, red cherry and vanilla combine effortlessly to provide a robust flavor profile that's memorable and rich.",93,65.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Reserve,Amici
US,"This is a rich yet soft and perfumed reserve-tier wine. It offers an explosion of dense black fruit, oak and tannin atop a singular foundation of clove and cinnamon-cola spiciness. Full bodied, it's youthful and not quite approachable, finishing in a muddle of cranberry crispness on the finish.",90,65.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Reserve,Amici
US,"This well-made wine opens in earthy compost and black licorice before unwinding a topknot of grippy tannin. Even with its power and concentration, it offers velvety mouthfeel and an expansive wave of juicy, robust acidity, particularly on the finish, making good use of smaller additions of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Merlot.",91,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,4.0,Reserve,Amici
US,"Floral and lush, this majority Cabernet Sauvignon contains 10% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, combining for a structured, layered wine accented in black cherry, cedar and dried herb. From vineyards strewn across the Napa Valley, including mountainside sites, it offers power and finesse and should sit well in cellar through 2022.",90,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Reserve,Amici
US,"This is rich, round, toasty and chocolaty, and it is instantly accessible and mouth filling. The forward fruit and barrel flavors coat the tongue with notes of cherries and chocolate. Drink soon, while the flavors remain fresh and balanced.",88,43.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2009,1.0,Reserve,Merrill Cellars
US,"This spent 18 months in neutral American oak, and has a strong woody scent and flavor. Light melon and cucumber fruit remains somewhat buried, and the mouthfeel is soft and diffuse. Drink up.",87,30.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2011,25.0,Reserve,Merrill Cellars
US,"Already aging quickly, this very ripe wine leans into the raisin and prune end of the flavor spectrum. Backed with a generous dose of baking spice, it's a soft and plummy wine ready for near-term enjoyment.",87,29.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2010,6.0,Reserve,Merrill Cellars
US,"The mouthfeel is flat and the flavors generic, despite the reserve designation. Light cranberry and pomegranate fruits are set against strongly herbal and earthy components.",85,29.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2012,6.0,Reserve,Merrill Cellars
US,"The first Reserve released by Parducci, this is dripping with bright cherry and strawberry flavors, and it has an earthy undertone. A trace of spice lingers on the palate.",85,33.0,California,Anderson Valley,Virginie Boone,2010,1.0,Reserve,Parducci
US,"Extremely flavorful and wonderfully exotic, this full-bodied wine has intense fruit flavors like raspberry and rhubarb, with a host of interesting accents recalling cedar, white pepper and clove. The mouthfeel is warm and rich, tannins are soft and easy, and the finish lingers nicely.",91,27.0,California,Mendocino,Jim Gordon,2014,26.0,Reserve,Parducci
US,"This is a dark, intensely astringent wine with so much grape and oak tannin that it's challenging to enjoy now. Since PV is known as a grape that provides color and tannin in Bordeaux wines, it's no wonder that it's so stiff today. It will drink best after 2020.",87,30.0,California,Mendocino,Jim Gordon,2013,43.0,Reserve,Parducci
US,"This is an exceptionally concentrated, smooth and delicious wine. It has ripe blueberry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, and its texture strikes the right balance between supple and tannic. A Coro Mendocino blend, it's made from a base of Zinfandel, with Petite Sirah, Syrah and a dash of Grenache. Delicious now, it also has the stuffing to age. Best from 2018.",93,38.0,California,Mendocino County,Jim Gordon,2013,3.0,Coro Mendocino,Parducci
US,"Comprised of 55% Zinfandel, 30% Petite Sirah, 10% Syrah and 5% Grenache. Rich in juicy cinnamon and leather, this is a well-textured wine with structured acidity that's very drinkable. It finishes with an exuberant lengthening of blackberries and tar. The Petite Sirah stands out most and should give the wine the chance to develop further with age.",88,40.0,California,Mendocino,Virginie Boone,2010,3.0,Coro Mendocino,Parducci
Argentina,"Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2015,18.0,Reserve,Domaine Bousquet
Argentina,"Earth, leather and herbal aromas blend with riper berry notes on the nose. This feels choppy, with cheek-scraping tannins. Flavors of minty herbal black fruits finish with chocolate, herbal flavors and stickiness.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Reserve,Domaine Bousquet
Argentina,"Full, creamy, lightly toasted aromas give way to a mature, mellow palate that's a bit flaccid. Nutty flavors suggest papaya and melon, while the finish is low on acidity and thus more flat than ideal.",86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2015,2.0,Reserve,Domaine Bousquet
Argentina,"Punchy citrus aromas are prickly on the nose. This wine is quite citric in feel, with lemon extract and lime taking charge.",84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2017,12.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Domaine Bousquet
Argentina,"Lightly oaked melon aromas are easygoing. This feels bright and citrusy, with good acidity but not much depth. Stone-fruit and tropical flavors finish with enough kick to hang around for a while.",86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2017,2.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Domaine Bousquet
Argentina,"A flat luster and mild aromas of wood and almost stale fruit get this wine off to a slow start. A full palate is sketchy in terms of acidity and balance, while this tastes cidery, with a bitter flavor of grapes skins on the finish.",84,20.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2016,2.0,Grand Reserve,Domaine Bousquet
US,"There's an abundance of ripeness and tropicality on the nose of this bottling, with aromas of apple-pear custard, mango, banana, yellow melon and even a touch of caramel. A strong upfront acidity flattens quickly into somewhat overpowering bubblegum and apple flavors.",85,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2014,18.0,Reserve,Villa San Juliette
US,"Graphite, tar, pine and smoldering campfire aromas show on the nose of this bottling, which only shows brief flashes of the grape's peppery, herbal core. There are forest floor hints on the palate, where dried mulberry flavors meet with pine and cracked pepper notes.",86,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2014,19.0,Reserve,Villa San Juliette
US,"Quite dark in the glass, this is a lush rather than lithe expression of the shapeshifting grape, with bright boysenberry, black plum, uncrushed peppercorn, soy, roast beef and espresso aromas. Black pepper shows on the palate, but blueberry and blackberry fruits dominate, boosted by a touch of dark chocolate and presented with solid acidic sizzle.",89,46.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2013,19.0,Reserve,Villa San Juliette
US,"Pink grapefruit, Meyer lemon and watermelon candy notes show on the nose of this rosé. There's a burst of vibrant energy to each sip, with lemon, raspberry and cherry syrup flavors. It's lively and fun.",87,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2015,9.0,Reserve,Villa San Juliette
US,"Rose petal, baked strawberry, sarsaparilla and baking spice aromas show strongly on the indulgent nose of this bottling. It's floral, full-bodied and multi-layered on the palate, with baked red cherry and cranberry flavors swathed in cinnamon, hibiscus and anise spice.",91,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2014,26.0,Reserve,Villa San Juliette
US,"More brooding in style, this deliciously rich bottling shows dense black cherry, black plum, blackberry and stewed strawberry on the nose alongside black cardamom, anise and curry spice. Layers of smoked meat and hoisin sauce decorate the purple flowers, dried red cherry and pencil-lead flavors of the palate.",92,32.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2013,26.0,Reserve,Villa San Juliette
US,"Extra dark in color, this has equally attention-getting dark chocolate and espresso aromas, rich black currant and blackberry flavors, and a firm, generously tannic texture. Although tempting to drink now, this will improve in complexity and smoothness through 2017.",90,39.0,California,Livermore Valley,Jim Gordon,2011,4.0,Reserve,McGrail
US,"This Cab boasts big cherry and vanilla-oak flavors, but it's slightly smoky and herbal, too. Entirely comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from Livermore, the wine might benefit from some more time in bottle, another 1–3 years.",86,39.0,California,Livermore Valley,Virginie Boone,2009,4.0,Reserve,McGrail
US,"Another nice effort from McGrail, a Cab from their estate vineyards that shows dark plum, vanilla and tobacco and a soft roundness, all around its tannins crying out for red meat.",88,36.0,California,Livermore Valley,Virginie Boone,2008,4.0,Reserve,McGrail
US,"An aromatically appealing wine with notes of cinnamon, chocolate and cherry. Unfortunately, it's quite tart with grainy, somewhat bitter tannins.",86,24.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2010,4.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"Aged in just one-third new French oak, this mostly shows the fruit, along with notes of green herbs, plum and currant accented by vanilla. The palate is medium bodied, slightly viscous in feel with a tart finish and dry tannins.",87,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2011,4.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front.",88,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Canoe Ridge, Wallula and Wahluke Slope vineyards. Aromas of dried herbs and leaves, green pepper and cherry are followed by a fruit-filled palate. The tannins come off as a bit scratchy.",88,25.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"Aromas of vanilla, cocoa, cashew and dried herb start out light and elusive but open up over time. Meanwhile the cherry flavors are sweet and creamy in feel, backed by firm, somewhat dry tannins.",89,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"A much more concentrated version of the regular bottling. The fruit is still raspberries and cherries, but there is more focus and power, and it’s wrapped in smooth milk chocolate. A flat-out delicious bottle of Merlot.",90,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,1998,17.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"This wine offers aromas of mocha powder, red apple, dark raspberries and woodspice. The red fruit flavors are quite sweet and concentrated, backed by a dry lick of tannins.",89,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"Equal parts Wallula and Canoe Ridge vineyard fruit, the aromas offer expressive notes of melon, flowers, jasmine and peach. The palate is textured and full, but the flavors at times seem a bit diluted. It shows some heat on the back end.",88,25.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"With fruit from The Benches (71%) and Canoe Ridge vineyards, this wine offers aromas of toast, pineapple, peach and pear, with barrel notes (100% American) providing accents. Flavors are creamy in feel with a finish that lingers.",90,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,2.0,Reserve,Canoe Ridge
US,"Supple, nicely balanced, but less meaty and full than the Merlot. The tannins are very well managed, and surprisingly smooth. Not satiny, given the wind beating that the vines take in the Horse Heaven Hills, but polished and ripe. Flavors of black olives and green tea come in behind the blackberry and cassis. There's a firm, Bordeaux-like profile.",90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,4.0,Estate Grown,Canoe Ridge
US,"Dark and plummy, with the characteristic black cherry fruit of the vineyard. There is also a streak of toffee that is a marker for the vineyard. Around 10% Cabernet Sauvignon was added; the aromas are fresh and sweet, with just a hint of coffee and herb. The tannins are smoothing out but will improve with more bottle age.",90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,17.0,Estate Grown,Canoe Ridge
US,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.",94,75.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,4.0,Reserve,Sheridan Vineyard
US,"This is 100% new oak (primarily Taransaud, 32 months), and it's a marvelous example of the grape, the vineyard and the strengths of Washington fruit. The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape. This is from the oldest block in the vineyard—now eight -year-old vines.",92,60.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2004,4.0,Reserve,Sheridan Vineyard
US,"This is just 14.2% alcohol, so despite the richness and ripeness, this is not fat or flabby. The fruit has concentrated black cherry and cassis flavors, and the smoky, pain grillé flavors of barrel aging are nicely integrated. Aromatically this wine is just beginning to evolve, with complex plum, prune, cherry liqueur, coffee and smoke.",93,60.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2004,6.0,Reserve,Sheridan Vineyard
US,Pressed black plum and crushed dill team up for a lively and fresh nose on this bottling that also offers tobacco and coffee aromas. Woody cedar flavors lead the palate that is full of lighter-toned strawberry and red-plum fruit. Black pepper adds spice and pencil lead adds minerality.,88,75.0,California,Temecula Valley,Matt Kettmann,2012,4.0,Reserve,Lorenzi Estate
US,"There are very ripe aromas of kirsch, cassis, licorice and root beer on the nose of this bottling, which begin to evolve into prunes, dried figs and raisins with time. The cola spice flavor is strong as are the prune and milk chocolate, all of which ride a strong tannic frame.",88,55.0,California,Temecula Valley,Matt Kettmann,2013,3.0,Reserve,Lorenzi Estate
US,"Based in Temecula, Lorenzi is trying its hand with Napa Valley Chardonnay here and not with the best results. The wine has a dark golden color and plenty of vanilla, pear and pineapple but on the finish the citrus is so sour it's tough to recommend.",83,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2009,2.0,Reserve,Lorenzi Estate
US,"This Syrah starts off earthy, musky, big and brawny and can't escape the wood-oaked herbal greenness on the finish. It's simply too high in alcohol.",84,46.0,California,Temecula Valley,Virginie Boone,2009,6.0,Reserve,Lorenzi Estate
US,"This is light in color and strikes the right strawberry tones. It's big and tannic, with weight and warmth on the finish.",85,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Virginie Boone,2009,26.0,Reserve,Lorenzi Estate
US,"This is one of the better Temecula Valley wines in recent memory, with dried blackberry, leather, tar and condensed purple flowers on the nose. There's a kiss of herbs upfront on the palate, followed by layers of tangy boysenberry, caramel and salt and pepper flavors. The structure is apparent but not in the way, and the acidity is lively.",93,48.0,California,Temecula Valley,Matt Kettmann,2013,6.0,Estate Grown,Lorenzi Estate
US,"Incredibly syrupy aromas of concentrated blueberry, blackberry, dried black cherry and kirsch show on the nose of this dense and dark bottling. It is a hearty sipper, with lots of espresso bean and cappuccino flavors, more dried cherry and blueberry, and some soy. The cooked flavors are a little overpowering but also luscious.",88,65.0,California,Temecula Valley,Matt Kettmann,2012,6.0,Estate Grown,Lorenzi Estate
US,"From this Temecula producer, a barrel selection of plum and black cherry Zinfandel with good depth and structure that's still got some tannins to work out but is ready to drink now.",88,28.0,California,California,Virginie Boone,2008,13.0,Barrel Select,Lorenzi Estate
US,"Barbecue smoke is prevalent both on the nose and palate, a characteristic that lays atop supple tannins and oak. This wine has a powerful bite of bitterness on the lean, herbal finish.",86,52.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Reserve,Rutherford Ranch
US,"This wine's oaky entry derives from 10 months aging in French and American oak. It's creamy and voluptuous in style, with simple flavors of apple and a moderately long finish.",87,25.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2015,2.0,Reserve,Rutherford Ranch
US,"Heavy butterscotch and crème brûlée aromas signal that this wine is in it for jam-packed flavor. But the nose doesn't translate to the palate, which instead becomes light and nondescript.",84,42.0,California,Carneros-Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Reserve,Rutherford Ranch
US,"Though the vineyard sources—Stillwater and Conner Lee—are first-rate, this wine seems a bit disjointed at the moment. Sweet, juicy fruit opens up into a midpalate that seems to have a hole, and then the aggressive flavors of vanilla surface. The vanilla-tinged finish feels tacked on, though perhaps some further bottle age will help to smooth it.",87,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,4.0,Reserve,Woodinville Wine Cellars
US,"The aromas of coffee, chocolate and exotic spices are brooding. Flavors are concentrated and layered, showing a good sense of texture and a light grip of tannins. The oak needs time to fully integrate.",92,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Reserve,Woodinville Wine Cellars
US,"This starts with concentrated boysenberry and raspberry fruit, but in the mouth some off-flavors intrude. The fruit is close to raisined, and the finish carries a hint of plastic. Two bottles tasted, consistent results.",85,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,6.0,Reserve,Woodinville Wine Cellars
US,"Coming mostly from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this wine is co-fermented with 4% Viognier. Dark fruit and orange peel aromas mix with sweet barrel spices. The blue fruit flavors are sweet and lush, carrying some warmth along with them.",88,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,6.0,Reserve,Woodinville Wine Cellars
US,"Juicy cranberry and pie cherry fruit brings this wine into clear focus. There is an underpinning of wet cement that comes across in the mid-palate, a sort of a stone wall that the fruit can't quite overcome. It fades into an astringent, tannic finish, still buoyed by those juicy acids.",87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,4.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"Moderately soft, loose-knit, and lightly herbal, this pure, single-vineyard Cabernet is a modest but charming effort with warm currant fruit. The aging in French and American oak shows a little too aggressively at the moment, so decant.",88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,4.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"A similar but bigger version of the Whistle Stop Red, this is made of all Cabernet, bearing rather hard tannins and flavors of coffee and clean earth. It's a good choice to pair with grilled cuts of beef.",89,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,4.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"This is showing an extraordinary amount of toasty oak in the nose, and once in the mouth it seems as if the oak and toast flavors overwhelm everything else. The fruit is very much on the light side, and can't begin to stand up to all the toast and butterscotch that is being tossed around. It's not bad, but it has not yet found its balance, and finishes with some lightly stemmy tannins.",84,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2004,4.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"The vanilla, cranberry, cherry and licorice aromas are elegant and light but seem ever so slightly dried out. Blackberry flavors stretch-out on the finish, with lightly dry tannins backing them up.",89,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"As always, a stylish and well-proportioned effort from winemaker Joy Anderson. Blackberry and smoke wrap into a mid-palate with good focus and grip. Despite its modest price, this wine can go one-on-one with a thick, juicy steak. Tannins are just rough enough to give it some welcome muscle.",89,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,4.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"Although it's just a guess, it seems clear that Snoqualmie was the loser in 2004, when so many small wineries were helped out by Chateau Ste. Michelle, which provided them grapes during a bad freeze year. Snoqualmie probably should not have made a reserve under the circumstances, as this falls well short of recent efforts. It's a light and simple wine, with thin candy cherry flavors and herbal streaks.",85,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2004,17.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"Much better than the watery 2004, this wine still seems a bit light and thin for its Reserve status. It's got some tart, sharp flavors of wild blackberry, but the herbal flavors suggest unripe grapes.",84,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,6.0,Reserve,Snoqualmie
US,"Aromas of wood spice, tar, green herbs and black cherry lead to plump fruit flavors. Grainy dry tannins provide support.",86,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Made with Organic Grapes,Snoqualmie
US,"The aromas are quite light for the variety, with the off-dry flavors lending some appeal.",83,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,23.0,Made with Organic Grapes,Snoqualmie
US,"This wine is soft and somewhat disjointed, uncertain of its structure. Highlights are caramel-toffee oak and a tease of anise amongst blackberry and black current.",84,95.0,California,Howell Mountain,Virginie Boone,2013,4.0,Reserve,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards
US,"Woody tannins support this full-bodied reserve wine's dark, brooding black fruit. Grippy on the palate, it combines forceful mocha, leather and cedar flavors with touches of sage and graphite.",88,85.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Virginie Boone,2013,4.0,Reserve,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards
US,"This impressive bottling is brightly substantial and tensely textured, lively in acidity and yet brimming with complexity. Stony lemon and peach ride a fruitful wave of flavor and find balance between sweet ripeness and memorable crispness.",92,25.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Virginie Boone,2015,12.0,Estate Grown,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards
US,"Aged in a majority of neutral French oak, the wine has opening aromas that impart generous toasty characteristics before mellowing into nutty, vanilla swirls and a lingering taste of green apple.",87,22.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Virginie Boone,2012,2.0,Estate Grown,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards
US,"This robust, richly layered wine shows lemon chiffon and vanilla characteristics balanced by golden apple and pear undertones.",90,27.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Virginie Boone,2015,2.0,Estate Grown,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards
Argentina,"Rich, oaky and earthy, with char to the bouquet. A little tannic and beefy, but with serious grip and feel. Tastes like savory, herb-infused berry and plum, while the finish is herbal, long and solid. Nice wine with an herbal streak and staunch tannins.",86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Reserve,Zolo
Argentina,"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.",88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserve,Zolo
Argentina,"Raw, reedy aromas of currant and cherry lead to a rubbery, pinched palate. Cherry and berry flavors are generic, as is the finish, which has hints of brown sugar. The blend is Merlot, Bonarda and Malbec.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2015,3.0,Signature,Zolo
Argentina,"Citrus, tropical notes and a bit of skunky funk define the nose on this unoaked Chard. The palate is slightly metallic in feel, while the flavors suggest canned peaches and nectarine.",83,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,2.0,Unoaked,Zolo
Argentina,"Sweet and honeyed, but flat and cloying. Candied melon and citrus flavors run heavy and chunky, and the finish is more of the same. Big, ripe, sticky and sweet but definitely not elevated in class.",83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,2.0,Unoaked,Zolo
Argentina,"Basic apple and vanilla bean aromas carry the nose to a plump, round palate with tropical flavors and banana. Feels peachy and tastes yeasty and sweet on the finish. Highly regular as a whole.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,2.0,Unoaked,Zolo
US,"This wine is a mix of fruit from Anna Marie and McClellan Estate vineyards. The aromas offer notes of dark roasted coffee, vanilla, herbs, spice and cherry, with the barrel notes initially at the fore. The palate is textured and supple, with the feel and flavors keeping the attention high.",91,45.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Reserve,Saviah
US,"Funk Estate (60%) and Watermill vineyards—both in The Rocks District—make up this wine. It's initially aromatically brooding with high-toned notes of stems, green herbs, coffee, funk and mineral, with generous floral notes providing accents. The palate is rounded and full, with fruit and savory flavors intertwining, showing a very pretty precision. The finish is lengthy.",93,45.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,6.0,Reserve,Saviah
US,"Lees aromas mix with notes of custard, poached pear, cinnamon and well-integrated barrel accents. The palate shows a sense of finesse and grace that carries through the finish.",89,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,2.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Saviah
US,"Pleasing aromas of fresh pear, tropical fruit, melted butter and vanilla are followed by rounded pear and vanilla flavors that show a light touch.",89,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Saviah
US,"Once again, the amazing Stillwater Creek vineyard comes through with a highly expressive, pure and intense Syrah that captures the heart and soul of a Washington State take on the grape. The sharp flavors of berries and spice mingle proportionately; the tannins are chiseled and the acids just right.",91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Saviah
Argentina,"Nervy cranberry and grainy-oak aromas struggle to achieve cohesion on the nose. Flavors of buttery oak, green herbs and berry fruits finish with herbaceous notes and a flabby feel.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2013,4.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Too heavy, murky and pruney on the nose; this wine has a lot of size but little freshness. It's big and bust-out, but with no direction or finesse it comes across earthy and oily. Only 250 cases made.",83,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Baked berry, savory bacon and coconut aromas give this Cab a modern, sweet outlook. In the mouth, it's more raw and abrasive, with firm tannins and lemony acids. Flavors of baked berry fruits and resiny oak finish chewy and tannic, with a touch of heat.",88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Hard, charred oak and cedar are the lead aromas on this woody Malbec, which also shows lemon peel and blackberry on the nose. The palate is tight and pushy, mixing flavors of toasty black fruits with raw oak resin and bitter chocolate. On the finish, there's heat and even more oak.",88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Oak is the main characteristic in this Malbec. Spicy aromas of clove and mint steer otherwise generic berry scents toward a thick palate with pointed acidity. This is short on complexity and the fruit is mildly sour, while mint, oak and baked notes define the finish.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"This may be the first time this wine has been labeled Reserve; in the past it was just Finca Sophenia Malbec. And truth be told, it's a good but regular Malbec with berries and raisin on the bouquet, and then juicy berry fruit on the palate. Solidly made, with solid structure.",86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Forceful from the opening, with floral notes, dark oak, shoe polish and char vying with black fruit aromas. Feels both lush and tough, with hard tannins poking through. Tastes of black fruits, cola and heavily toasted oak. Bittersweet on the finish; lusty and black but neither elegant nor light on its feet.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"This muscular Malbec opens with a blast of ripe berry aromas offset by oaky coconut notes. A plump palate avoids being pudgy, while plum, black cherry and blackberry flavors end with a turn of oaky vanilla and balancing residual acidity.",90,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2008,17.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"A complete Argentinean Merlot with aromas of light oak, fresh berries and spice that all come together in harmony. The palate is a little chewy and grabby, but it tastes and feels real and full, with good tannins. For a ripe wine it isn't conflicted, over the top or challenging. Drink now through 2009.",88,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2006,17.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Somewhat smoky and earthy on the nose, but also with some harshness that could be chalked up to youth. Acidity is a bit too high and there's some pickle to the bouquet and flavor profile. On the plus side, as it opens core flavors of raspberry and red plum come across as solid.",84,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2007,17.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Dusty orange and nectarine aromas are nice but highly regular. This feels round, easy and melony, while flavors of honeydew and pear are mellow and finish soft. It's friendly and quaffable.",85,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2014,2.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Yellowish to tan in color, this young wine is already showing signs of age, but get it early and you'll find creamy but sturdy flavors of squash, kumquat and peach. There's oak in support and plenty of personality. Whether that personality is universally appealing, however, is doubtful.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2007,2.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Dusty apple and peach aromas are mostly pleasant. Chunky and pulpy in feel, this basic Chardonnay tastes of melon and peach. A dry fleshy finish includes a sprinkle of saltiness. Drink now.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2015,2.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
Argentina,"Aromas of briny citrus and resiny oak don't blend together well. In the mouth, this oaky Viognier is grabby and resiny, with bitter green-fruit flavors. The finish is pithy with hard green notes.",83,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2012,25.0,Reserve,Finca Sophenia
US,"The aromas of dark coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and black cherry are still locked up but provide appeal. The flavors are textured and full, showing layers of dark fruit that undulate into the distance and display a fine sense of balance.",92,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from Beverly, Shaw and Stone Tree vineyards. Aged in all-new French oak, it leads with barrel spices followed by aromas and flavors of medicine cabinet, cherry and chocolate. It offers appeal but the tannins need time to unwind.",88,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"The reserve is still tightly wound, but expressive, with firm, focused flavors of cassis fruit, backed with a refreshing minerality. Chewy and stylish, its briary fruits carry through a long, sculpted finish with light accents of herb.",91,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Though it lacks the broad, sweet fruit of the 2005 reserve, this is a fine reflection of the vintage. It's compact, tannic, and a bit unyielding, but structured with enough density to age for a few years. Light red fruits are somewhat overwhelmed by grainy, toasty tannins; that should balance out with a little more bottle age.",89,27.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,4.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"A restrained and somewhat backward reserve, this is hiding its fruit behind a dry, somewhat earthy, wall of tannin. There are interesting nuances of seed, leaf and stem, along with a base fruit flavor of raspberry/cranberry, and the wine persists into a slightly bitter finish, but it seems to be holding itself back. A second bottle was better, with a little more fruit.",87,27.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,4.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"This reserve spent time in 100% new French oak, and shows better-than-average ripeness for this cool vintage. Fruit flavors of berry, cherry and a streak of cassis are at the core, with pleasing aromatics as well. A generous chocolate flavor runs into the finish.",89,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,4.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Aromas of vanilla, cocoa and dark berries lead to full-bodied and velvety coffee, cherry and dark fruit flavors. The oak plays prominently but this wine is still pretty hard to resist.",91,35.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,8.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer.",88,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,17.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"This has been barrel-fermented and aged, yet it retains more than a hint of the grape's natural herbaceousness. Sharp-edged and assertive, it might pass for a Quincy from the Loire Valley.",88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,12.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Brooding, very varietal aromas of grass, herbs and citrus lead to broad fruit flavors that dip in the middle, with some reduction providing a bit of distraction. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should perk up at the dinner table.",87,24.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,12.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"With buttered popcorn scents and flavors, underscored with pretty, toasty oak, this marries those flavors to a more restrained body, balanced with good acidity and showing fruit flavors of green apple and banana cream pie. Not a complex wine, but forward and flavorful.",88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"All coming from Block 95 of the winery's estate vineyard, this is a beguiling wine with a complex range of notes that include caramel, spice, squash and cream. It shows excellent balance, length and finesse, with the enjoyment as much about mouth-feel as flavor.",91,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2011,2.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Despite the wine being fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, the fruit shines through, with notes of corn silk, peach and tropical fruit accented by barrel spices. Texture and richness to the sweet fruit flavors keeps interest high.",90,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,2.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Aromas of butter, vanilla, corn silk and tropical fruit lead to barrel-forward, oak-laden pineapple flavors that intertwine through the finish. For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense.",90,26.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2015,2.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Though Columbia Crest is widely available, the reserve tier is not. Just a few hundred cases of this reserve were made, done in an oaky, buttered popcorn style. Think California with more acidity.",88,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,2.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Here is another fine effort from Columbia Crest that captures some spice and keeps the fruit bright and fresh. Apple and citrus flavors, sharp and tangy, run up against lots of barrel toast. The finish is loaded with baking spices and lightly touched with candied orange peel.",89,30.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2005,2.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"This wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. It doesn't all come together.",85,35.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,6.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Aromas of coffee, gravel and boysenberry are followed by pillowy-soft fruit and barrel flavors. It displays delicacy and nuance.",89,35.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,26.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Tart, leafy, with light strawberry fruit. This has little depth, just a pleasant strawberry nose and a simple, fruity palate.",84,35.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Paul Gregutt,2008,10.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Light aromas of white peach and flowers are followed by elegantly styled, off-dry stone-fruit flavors. It provides intrigue but doesn't entirely deliver.",87,26.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2015,30.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"Hailing from a single-vineyard block planted in 1979, this wine is aromatically reticent with notes of pear and flowers. It drinks off dry with stone- and tree-fruit flavors.",87,26.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,30.0,Reserve,Columbia Crest
US,"This exceptional effort is packed with sweet and tart fruits, beginning with lemon-lime, then moving through peaches and apricots and on into hints of papaya. Good length and splendid acidity.",90,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,7.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Freshly cut pear and tropical aromas lead to medium-bodied flavors. The style is clean and well made, with the concentration dipping a bit at times.",85,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,18.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"At first sharp and focused, with sharp aromas of pine and citrus rind, this broadens out and thins quickly once in the mouth. Fresh green apple fruit fades into a smooth, plain, slightly watery finish.",85,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,18.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"The aromas of milk chocolate, cherry and spice bring immediate appeal. The flavors are silky and polished, showing equal parts fruit and barrel.",90,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Cocoa, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by creamy-feeling blue-fruit flavors that display a mixture of fruit and barrel. The barrel influence is heavy, but it's delicious all the same.",90,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of blue fruit, herb, pencil lead and barrel spice are followed by smooth plum flavors. Milk chocolate notes persist on the finish.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,3.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Half of this wine is Merlot, with the rest Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Blueberry, coffee and vanilla aromas are followed by sultry plum flavors speckled with barrel accents before a mocha-flavored finish.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,3.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"This wine is 57% Syrah, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Viognier, 6% Merlot and 3% other varieties. The Viognier gives the aromas and deftly styled flavors, with notes of orange peel and flowers. The Syrah lends blueberries and gaminess, with herb and chocolate notes coming from Cabernet.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,3.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,17.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"This budget wine has sweet fruit and soft tannins, along with surprising concentration and length. Offsetting a hint of stemminess are generous, varietally true flavors, and a rich, meaty nose that suggests beef and coffee. Best Buy. —P.G.",87,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,1999,17.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"The Grand Estates Merlot has to be considered one of the best—if not the best—budget Merlots in the world. The color is pure and deep, there is a strong tannic spine, and the flavors of cassis and coffee, boysenberry and chocolate could be coming from a much more expensive bottle.",89,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,17.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Dark, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry come with a generous amount of espresso and dark, smoky toast. Highlights of anise and coffee grounds continue into a finish with slightly grainy tannins.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,17.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"The Grand Estates Merlot holds center court in the vast Columbia Crest portfolio. This new release, which has received extra bottle age, is seamless, smoky, supple and seductive. Exotic sandalwood and Asian spices weave from the nose into the palate, wrapped around broad black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A darker streak of black olive and licorice runs into a finish replete with tannins that are tight and hint at stem.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,17.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Generous and aromatic,  this flavorful Merlot is a showcase for ripe black cherry fruit, accented with strong streaks of vanilla and tobacco. The plush, dark fruit leads into a tasty, toasty finish, with notes of licorice and smoke.",90,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,17.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple.",84,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,12.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"This is a waxy, rather soft rendition of Sauvignon Blanc, and the pretty fruit flavors mix grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. There is very little suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc's herbal or grassy side; the grapes seem to have been ripened past that point, though not all the way to California-style, tropical fruit flavors. All in all this is a well-crafted, smooth and flavorful wine, with a portion barrel-aged for extra complexity.",87,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,12.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"An uneasy mix of steel and butter, this may just need a bit more time to settle. At the moment, the twin elements of metal and popcorn clash and compete. For those who love the buttery style, this should prove pleasing.",86,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"A fuller, richer, more broadly fruity version of the winery's Two Vines offering, this crowd-pleasing Chardonnay slathers the palate with buttery brioche, apple and Asian pear. A little more acidity would help; give it a chill to compensate.",86,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Pineapple and mango aromas mix with notes of baking spices. The flavors show a fine sense of balance, tapering toward the finish. It's oak driven at times but provides a lot of enjoyment.",87,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"For lovers of lush, buttery Chardonnay, this is the one to seek out. Generously toasty barrel flavors complement spicy pineapple fruit. It's forward, full-bodied and ready to drink now.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.",86,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"The oak makes the largest impression on this wine, with the notes of vanilla and butterscotch out in front of apple and apricot. It's creamy in feel, trailing slightly toward the finish.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"The Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest is consistently the most broadly fruity, round and oaky wine in the lineup (outside of the much pricier reserve). Apple, pear and peach fruit dominates, and the sometimes too-present, tarted up flavors of butter and vanilla have been brought back into better proportion in this 2006 bottling. Sure to be a popular style, this is one of the best vintages in the past five years.",87,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Big, bold, and buttery, with plenty of oaky micro-popcorn flavors. Don't look for subtlety, but you get plenty of flavor.",86,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Intensely oaky, buttery and creamy, this lush style also shows ample acidity, keeping the richness in check. It's big and borderline blowsy, but packed with flavor.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,2.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"This is a changed wine from previous vintages, now emphasizing the berry flavors of the fruit and not shying away from some chewy tannins. It seems more honest and direct, without the wash of vanilla and jam, and more food-friendly as well, with the stuffing to take on a flank or hanger steak.",87,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,6.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Barrel aromas of vanilla and mocha are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and blackberries. The palate displays a mixture of fruit and barrel flavors that linger through the finish.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,6.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price.",91,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2015,6.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Aromatically pleasing, this suggests fresh blueberry pie, with a whiff of smoked meat. It's straightforward with huckleberry and mocha flavors, trailing slightly toward the finish.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,6.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"From the use of the term Shiraz (rather than Syrah) to the sweet, vanilla-and-tobacco-laden flavors, this seems to be aimed squarely at the consumer who loves a forward, round and rather soft Australian-style wine. It delivers ripe berry flavors, silky tannins and plenty of up-front pleasure for the price.",86,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,24.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Pinot Grigio has yet to find a distinguishing style in Washington State. This is borderline generic, almost beery, a plain, pleasant, fairly neutral white wine with a mix of white peaches and green apples.",85,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,36.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"Here again the Grand Estates bottling shows a softer, gentler side of the fruit; the acids seem to have been smoothed over. The fruit is ripe and clean, suggesting white peaches and green apples, but there isn't much depth to it.",85,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,36.0,Grand Estates,Columbia Crest
US,"A fine, vivid, crystal-clear Pinot Gris, this offers cool cucumber and melon flavors first and foremost. It's a refreshing addition to the white wine lineup at H3.",88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2010,18.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Vivid and snappy, this was fermented in stainless steel, with a small percentage aged in neutral barrels to soften the mouthfeel. It's spicy and fresh, with a mix of fruit flavors including grapefruit and pineapple. A touch of vanilla enlivens the aromas.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2009,18.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Quite firm and focused, with a dominating scent of cut tobacco. The black cherry fruit is set against juicy acids, and rolls into a finish with streaks of licorice and more of that cut tobacco flavor.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2008,4.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Aromas of plum, stewed cherry, milk chocolate and vanilla are accented by notes of smoke. Fruit and barrel flavors intertwine on the palate, with fruit winning out on the finish that narrows a bit.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2015,4.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"The oak (40% new French and American) is up front, with aromas of barrel spices, cocoa and generous amounts of vanilla followed by cherries and blue fruit. This wine is velvety in feel, displaying a mixture of fruit and barrel that carries through the finish. The oak influence is heavy but the appeal is impossible to ignore.",90,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"The H3 Cab comes across as a more tightly defined, sharp-edged version of the Merlot. Same berry flavors, a bit more acid, and a sense that the wine goes deeper into the palate, though with less breadth. It feels taut in the middle, as if needing more bottle age and/or breathing time to flesh out, but the structure is sound and the flavors clean and varietal.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2006,4.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"This wide-open, flavorful wine is lifted by accents of tobacco and cocoa that sit above the light and pretty cherry flavor. The finish is laden with a mocha note, which provides a pleasing conclusion.",88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Strong scents of vanilla and fresh-baked pastry inform this wine, with a floral, lightly soapy character to the aromas. It is pleasant enough, but fades quickly.",85,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2009,4.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Aromas of toast, char, and milk chocolate along with blue and black fruit are followed by velvety soft fruit flavors. It shows an appealing sense of balance and polish.",89,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"This new lineup from Columbia Crest features fruit exclusively from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, which provides a welcome focus to the wines. Fruit-powered, but more substantial than either the Grand Estates or the Two Vines, this shows persistent flavors of tangy raspberry and blackberry, moderate acids and plenty of cocoa in the finish.",88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2006,17.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Nearly 100% Merlot with just a pinch of Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, it brings an assortment of red fruit notes along with plum, milk chocolate and coffee. The barrel flavors play a big part in the show with the tannins giving a lightly chalky feel.",89,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Aromas of plum and blue fruit are accented by high-toned spices and milk chocolate. Flavors are soft, palate coating and poised, with blue-fruit flavors lingering on the finish. It doesn't necessarily taste like Merlot but still brings plenty of appeal.",88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2015,17.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Light aromas of baking spice, vanilla and red fruit lead to well-balanced red-fruit and barrel flavors that taper toward the finish, with coffee flavors lingering.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,17.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"There is plenty of color and extract in this tannic wine. Blackberry fruit is at the core, and though aged in one third new oak, it is not evident in the flavors. A balanced and beautifully proportioned wine, which accurately captures the AVA's strengths.",89,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2007,17.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,Vanilla and cookie dough flavors dominate. The fruit is light and simple cherry candy; the tannins are equally light. Quaffable and refreshing.,86,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2009,17.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Solid and varietally correct, this brings citrus and melon fruit flavors in modest proportion to a simple, but balanced midpalate. It carries a hint of sugar in the finish.",86,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2010,12.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Appealing aromas of grass, herbs and tropical fruit lead to tart, sleekly styled fruit flavors that show a touch of bitterness on the finish.",86,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,12.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"A bit volatile, with a hint of fusil, light herb and cut grass flavors, and fruit that is just ripe enough. Green banana and green apple, with a soft mouthfeel and a gentle fade.",85,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2009,12.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Somewhat aromatically restrained with notes of kiwi, pineapple and citrus. It's somewhat sleek in style but has with a lightly creamy feel. The wine is enjoyable but the acidity doesn't quite seem to be there to pull it all together.",86,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,12.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"This popular Chardonnay gives you a generous burst of buttered nuts and toast, the flavors many consumers want in their Chardonnays. Not much going on in the fruit department—just clean, tart green apples, with a sharp, acidic edge.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2009,2.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"The latest release of the H3 Chardonnay shows plenty of fruit upfront (20% was fermented in stainless steel). Firm, crisp apple and a buttery finish set this clearly in the mainstream Columbia Crest style.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"This is an aromatically subdued wine with notes of peach, pineapple and spice. It's medium bodied, elegant in style with a lightly creamy feel, seeming a bit dilute.",86,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,2.0,H3,Columbia Crest
US,"Vanilla, toast and stone-fruit aromas are followed by light, elegantly styled flavors that show persistence. It comes off as a bit faint but what's there is pleasing.",87,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,H3,Columbia Crest
Australia,"A sweetly ripe amalgam of cassis, vanilla and cedar, this medium-bodied Cabernet is pleasant enough, if a little lacking in distinctiveness. It turns faintly dusty on the finish, making it suited to pair with burgers or steak.",85,12.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2009,4.0,Reserve,Yellow Tail
Australia,"Pineapples, pears and citrus fruits fall over each other in this soft, fruit-driven Chardonnay. It's medium in body, with just enough citrus on the finish to keep it together. A solid effort, especially for the price.",85,12.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2008,2.0,Reserve,Yellow Tail
Australia,"Round and lush, with boldly oaky notes of caramelized nuts and vanilla accenting tropical fruit. Drink now.",87,12.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2009,2.0,Reserve,Yellow Tail
US,"This rich, dark and earthy wine is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, done well and designed to appeal to those who favor dark barrel flavors along with their ripe fruit.

US,"Aromas are barrel forward, with notes of char, vanilla, toast and sweet spice. The barrel notes continue on the palate, overwhelming the fruit almost completely. It's a shame as there's good things to be had underneath.",87,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Reserve,Nodland
US,"Loaded with new oak, which in this case means it's cedary and very mentholly,  Under that is some tobacco and coffee.  Very drying tannins clamp down on the finish.",84,19.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Joe Czerwinski,1997,4.0,Reserve,Pindar Vineyards
US,"This intensely aromatic, off-dry Riesling jumps from the glass with a heady bouquet of flowers and tropical fruit. On the palate, flavors of peach and blossom are highlighted with brisk lemon-lime acidity.

Iijima,2012,12.0,Estate Bottled,Pindar Vineyards

Lurching toward the finish are flavors of caramel and bittersweet dried fruit.",86,65.0,California,Carneros,Virginie Boone,2012,2.0,Reserve,ZD
US,"Winemaker Chris Pisani used small American oak barrels to age this well-made, generous wine, which opens in a sweetness of vanilla bean, grilled peach and toasted oak.

US,"Pure purple fruit aromas arise on the nose of this bottling by pioneer Fred Brander, as do heady cocoa, leather and herb-crusted beef roast scents.

US,"This thick, rich and dense wine may need time to overcome its wealth of leathery sinew and black pepper. The fruit is elusive, allowing the savory elements to dominate all around.

US,"Absolutely huge fruit blows out of this bottle as soon as it's opened. A rush of gorgeous black cherry is buoyed by snappy acidity and generously finished with smoke and coffee accents from having aged in 50% new oak. Details of iron and baking spice emerge also, and the silky tannins glide through a lengthy and delightful finish.

US,"Lush aromas of cinnamon, black and red cherry, vanilla and toasted brioche show on this unabashedly potent and downright delicious bottling by the region's pioneering winery. Soft tannins joyously present rounded red-fruit and vanilla-cake flavors, with rich accents of cherry compote and chocolate chip cookie that are cut by streaks of bitterness and tartness. It's a voluptuous, attention-grabbing wine.",95,55.0,California,Paso Robles,Matt Kettmann,2014,4.0,Reserve,Justin
US,"Plenty of oak right out in front gives it a bountiful bouquet of smoke, toast, charcoal, etc. Underneath waits a nice core of black-cherry and cassis fruit, balanced with decent acids, but overall the wine seems lightweight for a reserve. It’s definitely ready to drink right now.",88,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Paul Gregutt,1996,4.0,Reserve,Fetzer

US,"Ryan Patrick's Reserve Cab is a round, subtle and forward wine that does not over-reach. The tangy fruit shows a mix of cassis and black raspberry fruit, then opens out into a darker mid-palate with licorice and coffee running solidly through to the finish. It's broad and open, and falls off in the finish, suggesting that this is a wine to enjoy in its youth.",88,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,4.0,Reserve,Ryan Patrick
US,"Ryan Patrick's reserve is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, though not labeled as such. It's a barrel selection, and very well done, with a purity and density that is most expressive. The acids and youthfulness of the fruit flavors suggest that this is a wine with aging potential. For now, it's showing bright, tart, tangy red fruits and fine balance.",90,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,3.0,Reserve,Ryan Patrick

Argentina,"This opens with huge aromas of dark berry, cola and maple. The palate is ultratannic and grabby, with a sandpaper mouthfeel and big, boistrous flavors of black fruit. Syrupy and tannic on the finish, it has an overt rugged feel.",84,15.0,Other,Patagonia,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserve,Restivo

Argentina,"Punchy red fruit aromas and plum notes give this Malbec energy up front. A ripe, round palate feels good and right. Spicy plum flavors with an herbal note finish woody, salty and with rubbery, lively tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserve,Proemio
Argentina,"Ripe black-plum aromas veer towards prune without fully going there. A full chewy palate holds blackberry and plum flavors, while this finishes oaky and lightly herbal. Overall, this captures much of what's good about Mendoza Malbec.",89,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2015,8.0,Reserve,Proemio
Argentina,"A fine value among moderately aged Malbecs. Smells like a well-grilled steak along with earthy berry and dry oak. Feels fresh and pure, with proper balance and a lively mix of toast, coconut, blackberry, spice and textured tannins. Compact and just right on the finish. 500 cases made; excellent for under $20.",91,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Reserve,Proemio

US,"This wine is delicious, rich and buttery, from the aroma through the flavors and on to the aftertaste.

Argentina,"Firm and focused berry aromas set up a full, weighty palate with dry tannins. Flavors of lightly herbal plum and berry are more generic and clean than special, while on the finish this feels smooth and tastes dark and fruity.",88,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Reserve,Domaine Jean Bousquet
Argentina,"While this is a bit rustic and herbal on first take, with time it settles and improves. Aromas of tomato and berry fruits lead to a crisp, firm palate with earthy plum, black cherry and herbal flavors. A soft fade away with earthy, baked notes doesn't hurt.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2012,17.0,Reserve,Domaine Jean Bousquet
Argentina,"More floral and blueberry driven than Bousquet's regular Merlot from '07 but not discernibly better or worse. The palate is round and the balance and feel are good. Flavors of floral blueberry follow the bouquet, and the finish shows a dash of sweet berry syrup and chocolate.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2007,17.0,Reserva,Domaine Jean Bousquet
US,"Herb, wood spice, coffee and cherry aromas are followed by broad and generous black-fruit flavors. The tannins provide some grip and need time to settle in.",91,85.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Reserve,Swiftwater Cellars

US,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. There's freshness to the fruit, with aromas of cherry and raspberry kissed by herb, clove and spice. The flavors are lush and palate-coating, with the tannins bringing a touch of astringency that hopefully will settle out with additional time in the bottle.",90,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,5.0,Proprietary,Swiftwater Cellars
US,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, this wine offers light aromas of cherry, coffee, raspberry, flowers, citrus and tobacco.

Sullivan,2012,5.0,Proprietary,Swiftwater Cellars

It's balanced and pleasant tasting, though lacking the depth that you might wish for in this price range.",88,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,5.0,Proprietary,Swiftwater Cellars
US,"This wine is a blend of the five Bordeaux varieties. It's aromatically reserved, with notes of flowers, high-toned herbs, wood spice and dark fruit, but it's not yet fully ready to reveal its charms. The flavors are dark and dense, with chewy, lightly dry tannins providing support. The finish stretches-out.",90,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,5.0,Proprietary,Swiftwater Cellars
Argentina,"A foxy-smelling, juicy, jammy Cabernet with wild berry and sweet oak aromas setting up a forward-feeling palate with plum, berry, sweet oak and resiny flavors. Presents itself as balanced and above average but doesn't go beyond that.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserve,Cueva de las Manos
Argentina,"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserve,Cueva de las Manos
Argentina,"Granular and punchy upfront, with heat and animal fur aromas on the nose. Settles with airing, revealing a heavy but solid palate with plenty of oak and candied red-fruit flavors. Falls off on the finish, with mint, resin and herbal notes.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserve,Cueva de las Manos
Argentina,"Opaque in color, this saturated Malbec-led blend exhibits coconut and cola aromas along with fully ripe blackberry notes. This is massive in the mouth, with a solid foundation. Maximum berry expression and a jammy, deep-fruited finish give this power and content beyond its price point.",91,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,3.0,Reserve,Cueva de las Manos
Argentina,"Smoky aromas of bacon and rubber blend with cherry and plum scents to form a good bouquet. This has a fair, fresh mouthfeel with tannic grip.

Argentina,"Berry and plum aromas are spicy and saucy, with secondary notes of tomato and oregano. Snappy on the palate, this live-wire Malbec is a bit aggressive and acidic. Toasty oak and mint flavors accent fresh red-berry fruit prior to an energetic yet woody finish that's raw feeling but fair.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserve,Ferllen
Argentina,"Soupy tomato, plum and green tobacco aromas feed into a pinched biting rubbery palate. This Merlot tastes roasted and oaky, with baked plum and berry flavors matched by clove and chocolate notes. A drawing tannic finish tastes stewy and woody.",85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,17.0,Reserve,Ferllen
US,"Aromas and flavors of blackberry, pomegranate, leather and cedar are warmed by baking spice and bitter chocolate on the palate. The tannins are firm and lend plenty of structure. Cedar and tobacco prevail on the finish, with a touch of warmth.",86,25.0,Texas,Texas,Fiona Adams,2012,4.0,Reserve,Becker

Perfectly enjoyable as an apéritif.",85,22.0,Texas,Texas High Plains,Alexander Peartree,2014,25.0,Reserve,Becker
US,"There's a density to this Tempranillo that teeters the line of being almost too rich. The nose is all about stewed red and black berries, with cedar, anise and warm vanilla.

US,"Full-bodied and firmly structured, this smells a bit peppery and roasted, then gives up dried cherry and blackberry flavors that fill the mouth and taste generous and soothing. It has benefited from the extra age since bottling, and is ready to enjoy.",89,34.0,California,Mendocino,Jim Gordon,2009,17.0,Reserve,Brutocao
US,"A powerful and concentrated wine, this has dark fruit aromas like black cherry along with black pepper and wood smoke, plus strong, ripe flavors from cherry to blackberry and black currant. It also has a lot of tannin and good acidity, and will mature into a softer feel over time.",89,34.0,California,Mendocino,Jim Gordon,2010,17.0,Reserve,Brutocao
US,"Comprised of 66% Zinfandel, 20% Barbera and 14% Primitivo. Brutocao has gone in a different direction than most of its 2010 Coro counterparts. It mixes in Barbera, presumably for acidity and freshness, to the bigger boned personalities of Zin and Primitivo. In the end, the fruit and acidity are dulled by the toffee and oak and grippy, grizzled leather in this wine.",85,40.0,California,Mendocino,Virginie Boone,2010,3.0,Coro Mendocino,Brutocao
US,"The distinctive aroma resembles tamarind, cranberries and new oak barrels. Flavors are bright and pure, and the mouthfeel is firm with tannins while staying smooth and velvety.

US,"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate.",92,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,17.0,Estate Grown,Ballentine
US,"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Dense in black licorice and toasty oak, the fruit character is dominated by red plum and berry aromas and flavors.",92,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,17.0,Estate Grown,Ballentine
US,"Chocolate and plum flavors abound in syrupy concentration in this rich, round and ripe wine.

US,"This is a well-structured and elegant wine, despite its size. Bright red cassis and cherry play under tannins that hit on the back of the palate, taking a moment to soften. Herb and cedar mark the finish.",89,34.0,California,St. Helena,Virginie Boone,2013,17.0,Estate Grown,Ballentine

Argentina,"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as “oaky.”",87,46.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Reserve,Melipal
Argentina,"Like many wines from this vintage, Melipal seems afflicted with 2005 blues. It has black plum and some woody char to chew on, but also saline and frisky tartness. Gets better with airing and will show best with food, but it's clearly a step down from prior years.",86,28.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2005,8.0,Reserve,Melipal
Argentina,"Raspberry and cherry aromas are light and pleasing, while the palate exhibits those same friendly and inviting raspberry flavors along with some citrus.

Argentina,"Sweet black fruit aromas come with notes of animal hide, brown sugar, prune and fern. Feels good but a touch scratchy and acidic, with dark spice, ample barrel influence, vanilla and blackberry flavors. Tastes minty and fades quickly on the finish.",87,20.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Reserve,Filus
Argentina,"Lightly volatile, balsamic aromas blend with cedary notes and berry scents. This feels round and fresh, which is typical of the Uco Valley. Blueberry, spiced plum and cassis flavors finish with chocolaty oak and mocha flavors as well as juicy acidity.",90,19.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserve,Filus
Argentina,"Compost aromas blend with thicker, richer raisiny notes. This feels deep and almost heavy on the palate, where the acidity is modest and stewed, with hints of herbal flavor. Black currant and blackberry come across fully ripe. Notes of coffee, herbs and salt dictate the finishing flavors on this huge Malbec.",87,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserve,Filus
Argentina,"Grapy, meaty aromas are loud and all over the map. The palate of this purple Cafayate Malbec is saturated and loaded with pulp, tannins and bulk. Roasted blackberry and cured-meat flavors finish mellow and soft, without much length.",88,17.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"This is a highly fragrant Torrontés with exotic tropical aromas of lychee and bath oil. Light and fresh in body, this tastes of pithy citrus and lychee before hollowing out. A lingering finish with good acidity is the close.",87,17.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2015,37.0,Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,High-toned floral and tropical aromas are vivacious. A racy palate with bold acidity is the stage for lychee and flowery flavors. A full finish with bitter edges is true and textbook for Salta Torrontés.,88,16.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2016,37.0,Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"Aromas of leather, graphite, saucy berry and tomato are good but not necessarily inviting. This high-elevation Cabernet is bouncy in feel and solid in structure. Flavors of briny berry fruits come with oaky notes of vanilla and caramel, while the finish is chocolaty but quickly loses its fruit character.",88,24.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Grand Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"Rooty, stalky, earthy aromas are spread wide and thin. This Cab has a gritty feel and hard tannins. Stalky flavors of coffee grinds are herbal and tough, while heat, sauciness and tomato-leaf flavors suggest cool-climate origins. Overall this is racy and cool in style; drink now.",87,22.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2011,4.0,Grand Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Grand Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"Fully oaked, and you can tell via the aromas of coconut, resin, vanilla and latex that sit on top of tobacco and floral berry scents. Feels tight and high in acid, with herbal-leaning red berry flavors. Fresh and basic on the finish, with lasting acidity.",87,25.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Grand Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"Piattelli is an under-the-radar label that makes very good to excellent Malbec from old vines in Luján del Cuyo, Mendoza. And the prices are more than fair. This wine is big and focused, with intense blackberry, chocolate and espresso qualities throughout. And the finish is midnight dark. Good through 2012.",92,20.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Grand Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"This pitch-dark Malbec from Cafayate is concentrated and heavy on the nose, with grapy blackberry aromas that are doing their best to stay fresh and clean. A full-force, grapy palate deals chocolaty black-fruit flavors in front of a warm finish where toasty oak and graphite notes come onto the scene.",89,22.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Grand Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"Bulky and dark up front, with coconut, ripe berry and heat on the nose. Feels rich and resiny, with sticky tannins, extract galore and flavors of coconut, wood grain, black licorice and sweet blackberry. Finishes hefty and grabby, with wayward oak that needs to settle in.",89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Grand Reserve,Piattelli
Argentina,"Hard and capped on the bouquet, with plastic aromas, dry oak, milk chocolate and mint. Feels resiny and cloying, with wood-led flavors and resin. Tastes bland and overoaked for what it is.",83,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Premium,Piattelli
Argentina,"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",89,12.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2005,8.0,Premium,Piattelli
Argentina,"Best on the nose, which is floral as it mixes in big black fruit notes and coconut. The palate has a creamy, grabby feel and then confected flavors of carob, vanilla and baked berry. Finishes heavy and very sweet, i.e. syrupy.",84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Premium,Piattelli
Argentina,"Pithy green fruit aromas are short but within normal parameters for the variety. Feels a bit heavy, with a baNAa influence. Flavors of soft citrus and melon are middling, while the finish is weighty.",83,16.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2010,37.0,Premium,Piattelli
Argentina,"Purple, smoky and dense but beyond that it's regular. The palate is racy and medium deep, but the flavors are more superficial than interesting. Finishes quick, with coffee and bitter chocolate flavors.",84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserve,Caligiore
Argentina,"Berry and plum aromas come with notes of woodsmoke and rubber. A fresh but common mouthfeel is pleasant, while red-berry flavors lead the palate and come with a touch of creamy oak. Hence, vanilla and additional cream flavors are key components of the finish.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserve,Caligiore
Argentina,"Berry and black plum aromas build the nose. It's bold but a little acidic, with medium intensity and weight supporting snappy flavors of wild blackberry and slightly tart plum. The finish is quick and juicy.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserve,Caligiore
Argentina,"The dark and penetrating aromas of violets, shoe polish, blackberry and road tar are solid. This feels a bit tough on the palate, with narrow tannins and flavors of rubber and black plum.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,6.0,Reserve,Caligiore
Argentina,"Initially this smells earthy and rubbery, but with airing it shows roasted dark-berry aromas mixed with horsey leather. The palate is full, tannic and scratchy, with black-fruit flavors, pepper, toast and herbal notes. Toast and coffee flavors are found on a hard, tannic finish. Tasted twice with mixed results.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,6.0,Reserve,Caligiore
Argentina,Angular and overcrowded with rhubarb aromas and flavors. There isn't any finesse to this wine and only a modicum of acceptable fruit and body. Tart at the core.,80,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,6.0,Reserve,Caligiore
US,"Bright, jammy aromas and ripe, lively, chocolate and cherry flavors give a lot of personality to this velvet-textured wine. Medium to full bodied, it has a good blanket of fine tannins to coat the tongue and give the wine grip.",88,20.0,California,Lodi,Jim Gordon,2010,8.0,Reserve,Ironstone
US,"Combining rich cinnamon and clove aromas with ripe blackberry and nutmeg flavors and very firm tannins, this is a full-throttle red. A sense of concentration and focus marks the fruit notes, and all is framed by astringency that cleanses the palate. It will be best after 2016.",87,20.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2010,19.0,Reserve,Ironstone
US,"Quite a bit of power comes with this densely flavored, quite tannic and full-bodied wine. It smells almost roasted, but it offers nice, ripe berry, black cherry and dark chocolate flavors, a thick and astringent texture and lingering finish.",88,20.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2011,19.0,Reserve,Ironstone
US,"This is an assertive wine with an herbal personality. Aromas resemble citrus and fresh herbs, the flavors are citrusy and savory, and the mouthfeel is rather generous.",86,20.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Jim Gordon,2012,25.0,Reserve,Ironstone
US,"This smells like toasted bread and hickory smoke and tastes even more charred and smoky. Like a good barbecue sauce it has a sweet touch to balance the smoky, jammy fruit flavors. This is an extreme taste experience that will be a big hit with some.",85,12.0,California,Lodi,Jim Gordon,2013,13.0,Old Vines,Ironstone
US,"Lots of fun to sip this showy, overt, no-holds-barred Zin. Lavish use of new oak gives aromas of toasted bread, maple syrup and smoked bacon. The flavors say ripe strawberries and sweet blackberry jam, and the finish is sweet and spicy at the same time.",89,12.0,California,Lodi,Jim Gordon,2012,13.0,Old Vines,Ironstone
Argentina,"Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose. In the mouth, it's all about earthy, intense berry fruit and juicy freshness. Finishes a little tart but lively, with good form and feel.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Reserve,Tamarí
Argentina,"Dusty, earthy and herbal defines the nose on this minty Cab. There are also whiffs of animal and pickle on the bouquet. This feels raw and tight, with crisp acids and peppery, lightly herbal flavors of plum and berry. A minty, dry finish is slightly harsh.",83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,4.0,Reserva,Tamarí
Argentina,"Floral red-fruit aromas are modest but clean. The palate is a bit chunky but overall it's in good shape. Flavors of berry and cassis are ordinary, but the flavor profile is perfectly good. A touch of chocolate and oak rise up on the finish.",88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Reserva,Tamarí
Argentina,"Crusty, rubbery aromas smell a bit burnt, while leather and berry aromas, rest below the surface. The palate is full, edgy and a little tangy, with red plum, herb and tomato flavors. Mild and saucy tasting on the finish.",85,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserva,Tamarí
Argentina,"Dry earthy aromas of herbal raspberry and tomato are reserved in a good way. There's acidic lift to a rugged palate, while berry fruit flavors blend with spice notes prior to a tannic finish.",88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Reserva,Tamarí
Argentina,"Earth and rubber notes on the bouquet give way to black fruit and black olive aromas. It feels fresh, with a good acid level and a solid body supporting flavors of wild berry, plum and spice. The finish is toasty, with a fair amount of oak and bacon flavors.",88,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserva,Tamarí
Argentina,"Powdery, tropical aromas are light and fresh. And that pretty much describes the wine. In the mouth, it's bouncy, with citrus flavors, tropicality and a hint of nutmeg. The finish is true to the grape, with nice feel and clarity.",87,13.0,Other,La Rioja,Michael Schachner,2011,37.0,Reserva,Tamarí

Argentina,"A touch rubbery and medicinal if you get deep into the bouquet, with sizable berry aromas to boot. The palate is comfortable and balanced, with earthy black fruit flavors that suggest fig and blackberry. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish.",87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserve,Menduco

It feels juicy, full, lively and fresh, with oaky dark-plum flavors accented by rooty, herbal notes. Dry tannins mark the finish.",88,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserve,Menduco

Pithy and citrusy on the finish. Ripe and good in a regular way.",86,12.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2010,37.0,Reserve,Menduco
Argentina,"This is a hot, earthy Malbec with cover-up oak on the nose. A high-acid palate is drying and hard, with narrow, salty berry flavors and a peppery tasting, scratchy finish.",81,10.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserve,Finca Las Moras
Argentina,"Leathery, feral aromas including stemmy notes define the nose on this just-good-enough Malbec. There's not much give to the acidic palate, while flavors of mint and red fruits finish scratchy.",83,11.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserve,Finca Las Moras
Argentina,"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.",85,12.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2007,2.0,Reserve,Finca Las Moras
US,"At first blush this reserve seems more oaky, more open and more overtly alcoholic than the just-released Leonetti 2008 Merlot and 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon. After many hours of breathing time it fills in with pretty plummy fruit, toast, caramel, whiffs of smoke, cedar and cigar box, and dry tannins.",93,135.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,3.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling.",95,140.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,5.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit––especially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge.",96,135.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,5.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"This wine is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Petit Verdot and 8% Merlot, coming from Seven Hills, Loess and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. Light aromas of toast, barrel tones, flowers, licorice and dark fruit are followed by earth and other savory flavors that are light but still show weight and density.",92,150.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,5.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"Leonetti's 2009 Reserve—92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot—is a simpler blend than in past vintages, and it seems to mark a return to the style of wine that built the winery's reputation initially. Powerfully, lavishly oaky, with a ripe, chewy black-fruit flavor, it is bursting with notes of black cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and a hint of butter. Though not quite as graceful or detailed as the regular Cabernet, this is the more potently expressive of the two flagship Leonetti reds.",94,140.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,5.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"Just over 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Malbec (10%), Petit Verdot (8%) and Merlot, this wine offers brooding but well-delineated aromas and flavors of blackberry, dried flowers, black tea, herbs, earth, barrel spices and light meaty notes. It's packed tightly with firm tannins and also shows great length. Drink 2022–2028.",94,150.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,5.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this reserve is aromatically distinctive. A suggestion of grapefruit in the underlying acidity outlines pretty boysenberry, mulberry and sweet spices. It's beautifully balanced.",93,140.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,5.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"This wine is a blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec and 8% Petit Verdot from Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Serra Pedace vineyards. Aromas of fresh herbs, scorched earth, mineral, and red and black fruit—slightly dried-out-seeming—lead to a silky textured concentrated palate. The tannins are there but are beautifully integrated. It shows plenty of hang time on the finish. It should have a good 15 years in front of it. Best from 2024–2030.",93,150.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,5.0,Reserve,Leonetti Cellar
US,"A whiff of Graham cracker lends a warm, spicy tone to youthful black cherry and plum flavors in this bold blend that includes small proportions of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. Lush and fruity on the palate, it maintains elegance with a vein of granite minerality and grippy, mouthfilling tannins.",89,34.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2010,3.0,Reserve,T'Jara
US,"While sweet on the nose with aromas of cherry vanilla and wet cedar, the palate on this medium-bodied blend is a bit soft and stewed with overripe red fruit and hints of tomato sauce.

Iijima,2007,3.0,Reserve,T'Jara

Iijima,2013,5.0,Reserve,T'Jara
US,"This is 75% Merlot, with Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah comprising the other 25%. Despite all of the components, it tastes like there is a bit of a hole. The fruit is soft and plummy, and the overall balance is excellent.",88,45.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2009,17.0,Reserve,Obelisco Estate

US,"This brings a tight but well-balanced blend of cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors, with snappy acidity. The fruit is bolstered with firm, lightly earthy tannins. It was aged in a mix of half American, half French, all-neutral oak.",89,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2010,8.0,Estate Grown,Obelisco Estate
US,"Aged in equal parts French and American oak (43% new), this initially puts barrel tones in the lead. Notes of toasty spices, cocoa, toffee and coffee come out in front of blue and black fruit. The flavors are sweet but reserved in style, trailing toward the finish. There's a lot to enjoy but the oak seems a little overweighted for the fruit that's in the bottle.",88,45.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,8.0,Estate Grown,Obelisco Estate
US,"Production size of this pure, estate-grown, Red Mountain Malbec is much lower in 2011. Earthy and showing a whiff of leather, it brings dried cherry fruit, a streak of dark chocolate and smooth tannins in a juicy wine with a lively finish.

US,"This soft, supple and seductive Merlot (with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend) is both earthy and sensuous. The mouthfeel is like smooth felt.

US,"This stunning red was a favorite amidst a strong line up of North Fork Cabernet Franc. There's a purity of black cherry and plum flavors here, but also meandering veins of animal, earth and herb that feel a bit savage and wild. Crisply composed, it finishes with delicate whispers of anise and cinnamon. Ready to drink now but should improve through 2024.",92,35.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2014,19.0,Reserve,Macari
US,"Fresh apple, lemon and crushed mineral tones are demure on the nose but gain power and concentration on the palate of this bold, richly textured Chardonnay. Denser and more muscular in mouthfeel than its regular-label bottling, it's accented by just a whiff of spice and vanilla cream. Drink now through 2023.",90,27.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2013,2.0,Reserve,Macari
US,"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking.",80,19.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Joe Czerwinski,1997,19.0,Estate Bottled,Macari

US,"While 16 months in French barriques lends roundness of mouthfeel, there's hardly any oak embellishment here.

US,"Equal parts power and grace, this wine appeals widely with its forward, concentrated apple and lemon flavors.

US,"While unoaked, this tropical swirl of mango, guava and pineapple is unabashedly rich in style. Decadent caramel and butterscotch notes are a bit on the confected side but clean up tidily against a streak of sunny lemon on the mid palate.

US,"Typical of the variety, this shows upfront aromas of fresh green pepper, eucalyptus, black pepper and blackberry.

US,"This vineyard-designated Sauv Blanc is half fermented in stainless steel, 40% in concrete eggs and the rest in French oak. It is completely different from the winery's Columbia Valley bottling, with much riper and rounder fruit flavors showing off stone fruits, such as peaches and apricots, along with tropical hints of papaya. There's plenty of stuffing and spice, and a perfect mix of the grape's innate herbaceous and grassy qualities, ramped up with riper, sweeter fruit.",91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,12.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Matthews
US,"With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce.

US,"Abundant flavors and fresh-tasting acidity come together in this full-bodied wine to form a complete, complex package. Yes, there is a vivid streak of vanilla and nutmeg from aging in all American oak barrels but the ripe apple flavors and underlying crispness keep those from overwhelming.",90,18.0,California,Lake County,Jim Gordon,2012,2.0,Reserve,Wildhurst

US,"Januik's reserve blend is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Franc.

US,"A blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec, this wine is more about elegance and detail than outright power, though it brings plenty of that as well.

Sullivan,2012,5.0,Reserve,Januik
US,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (87%), Merlot (10%) and Cabernet Franc, with the fruit coming from Weinbau, Champoux, Lady Hawk and Ciel du Cheval vineyards.

It's drinking very well, with complex flavors of strawberry and baking spices, nicely integrated.",90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,16.0,Rosé of,Lauren Ashton Cellars
Australia,"Featuring a voluptuous nose of stone fruit and citrus framed by roasted nuts and toasty oak, this is a rich, amply endowed Chardonnay with a big personality and bold flavors. Ripe peach notes join with citrus, hazelnuts and toast on the long finish. Drink now.",92,27.0,Western Australia,Pemberton,Joe Czerwinski,2005,2.0,Reserve,Wise
Australia,"Very similar in style and feel to the 2005 offering, Wise's 2006 Single Vineyard Chardonnay is a crisp, nicely structured wine with a preponderance of citrus and toasty oak flavors. Apple and pear notes add just the right amount of fleshiness.",90,27.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2006,2.0,Single Vineyard,Wise
Australia,"Fans of structured Chard should give this a try. Ripe citrus flavors are subtly framed by toasty oak in a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp and minerally. Good now, but should last through 2010.",90,27.0,Western Australia,Western Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2005,2.0,Single Vineyard,Wise
US,"Bruised apricot, lemonade and citrus rind-laden marzipan notes hit the nose on this wine, which is showing just a touch of nutty, honeyed oxidization. The macadamia nut element arises on the palate too, alongside intriguingly peaty flavors reminiscent of Scotch, with almond liqueur on the outro. It presents decent acidity throughout.",88,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Matt Kettmann,2012,2.0,Reserve,Wrights Station
US,"Asian pear, candied lemon rinds and the slightest hint of marshmallow show on the nose of this bottling from a northeast-facing vineyard 1,800 feet up in the appellation. Fresh flavors of nectarine and white peach are pleasurably subtle, backed by both warmed lemon-butter elements and salty, savory acidity.",92,35.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Matt Kettmann,2014,2.0,Reserve,Wrights Station
US,"This is an impressive take on the unoaked style, with pithy aromas of grapefruit and quinine leading into a tropical sense of guava skins, melon rinds and white-peach flesh. The acidity is mellow but persistent on the sip, where Key lime, pink grapefruit and sharp citrus flavors shine.",92,25.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Matt Kettmann,2014,2.0,Unoaked,Wrights Station
US,"These biodynamic grapes, fermented with native yeasts, spent three months in 40% new French oak. It's built like a precision watch, ticking off complete and balanced varietal flavors of citrus rind and juice, with light touches of fresh herb, lemon verbena and a delicate hint of vanilla.",93,50.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2015,25.0,Reserve,Cowhorn
US,"This wine spent three months in 38% new French oak, which softens and adds a bit of barrel-induced richness to the mouthfeel. It remains a fascinating mix of flower and citrus, with lightly-buttered toast and a lush, lemon-custard flavor.",92,50.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,25.0,Reserve,Cowhorn
US,"Sleek and sappy, this was fermented with native yeast and aged nine months in 50% new French oak. There's a spine of iron keeping it a bit stiff and compact, with concentrated fruit flavors of crème de cassis. Still young and slightly grapey, it's best to cellar it a few more years, for a drinking window of 2020 to 2030.",94,75.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,6.0,Reserve,Cowhorn
US,"Black as coal, with a heavy, smoky, meaty nose, this is one of a growing number of excellent biodynamic Syrahs from Oregon. It marries tangy acids to chewy red and blue fruits, with streaks of coffee liqueur and caramel latté. Half was whole-cluster fermented, and it all spent time in 50% new French oak.",92,75.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,6.0,Reserve,Cowhorn
US,"Kiona Vineyard on Red Mountain provides the fruit for this wine, along with Chandler Reach in the Yakima Valley.

US,"Sourced from the Kiona vineyard on Red Mountain, and vinified in Oregon, this features a brambly, berry-strewn mid-palate with dried leaves and spices adding further interest. It rolls pleasantly across the palate into a tart, fruity finish.",88,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,6.0,Reserve,Hawkins Cellars

US,"From a cool climate region, this brings crisp raspberry fruit with underlying minerality. Aging in one-third new French oak adds in notes of dusty coffee grounds and a hint of milk chocolate. The wine starts out tight, then fans out through the finish.",88,34.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Paul Gregutt,2013,6.0,Reserve,Phelps Creek
US,"This is the most concentrated of the current lineup of Phelps Creek Pinots, and carries a distinctly earthy note of compost in the nose, along with leaf and cherry and herb. It has some weight and authority on the palate, with a mix of cherry tomato and fresh herb dominating.",88,42.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Paul Gregutt,2007,1.0,Estate Reserve,Phelps Creek
US,"The Celilo vineyard, located on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge appellation, is one of the most unique in the region. This ripe, almost liquorous Merlot is bursting with sappy cherry fruit, buttressed with tangy acids. The structure is here to more than support the weight of the wine and its alcohol, just under 15%. Barrel flavors of bourbon and vanilla dominate the finish.",88,24.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Paul Gregutt,2006,17.0,Celilo Vineyard,Phelps Creek
US,"Rich Cushman made this wine; it nicely expresses the minerality and tight fruit that characterizes this excellent vineyard.

US,"A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA. It got the full malolactic, fermented in French oak treatment, and shows plenty of pleasing barrel toast and spice. The fruit mixes hints of peach and melon with a lemon drop core, and finishes with a lick of butterscotch.",90,24.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Paul Gregutt,2008,2.0,Celilo Vineyard,Phelps Creek
US,"Searingly tart, this might be a 2007 Muscadet for its thrilling, stiletto-steel spine and leesy minerality. Simply calling it unoaked does not begin to do justice to the complexity and textural density that this unusual Oregon Chardonnay offers. For acid lovers who don't think that Chardonnay must be slathered in toasty new wood in order to have any flavor, this wine will be a joy.",89,18.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Paul Gregutt,2007,2.0,Unoaked,Phelps Creek

US,"Well-integrated oak, deliciously ripe fruit flavors and an absolutely luscious texture make a great combination for this very full-bodied wine.

Argentina,"Trapiche's Broquel line has never featured Pinot Noir before, and maybe this is why. Talk about a sharp, scouring wine. It's lemony and lean, with piercing cranberry flavors and razor-sharp acidity. Crispness is one thing; sharp and edgy is another.",80,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,1.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Mild plum and berry aromas are smell a bit like aromatized soap. With cherry, raspberry and brown sugar flavors, this is a friendly wine without much Pinot character.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,1.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Earthy, woodsy, spicy aromas set up an electric, almost overcharged palate with no finesse. Bright cherry flavors turn peppery as the finish tastes blackened and bitter. Overly lively and unsettled.",83,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,1.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Earthy and leafy aromas yield to tomato leaf and weighty plum aromas. The palate is full but sharp, with tart, driving pie cherry and herbal flavors. Stays rather hard on the finish, where more tomato rolls out.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,1.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Loamy berry aromas smell a bit like wet clay and earth. This is fairly well structured, with grippy tannins. Baked, savory, oaky berry flavors finish with wood spice, clove and light herbal notes.",88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Spice, licorice and herbal notes complement red-fruit aromas, while the palate offers plenty of structure and tannic grab. There's an avalanche of blackberry, cassis, fig, chocolate and herbal flavors to process, while the finish is rich and rewarding before breaking up in bits.",90,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Narrow berry aromas are straightforward but not complex. This is a smooth operator with round tannins, plenty of body and a mix of black fruits, licorice, herbs and spices on the flavor profile. Flavors turn more herbal on the finish, where oregano and thyme accent tastes of cassis and berry.",89,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,4.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Dark, smoky black-fruit aromas include graphite. This is round, chewy and balanced on the palate, with ripe but standard flavors of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Notes of burnt toast and char appear on a solid, ripe finish.",89,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,4.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Smoky and leathery on the nose, with earthy blackberry aromas, tobacco and tree bark aromas. The palate runs sort of heavy, tannic and raw, with grapey flavors of black currant and roasted plum. A chunky, earthy, roasted style of Cab to drink now.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Cassis, sugar beet, leather and mild herbal aromas make this Cabernet appealing on the nose. It feels slightly syrupy and resiny, but with its core acidity the palate remains in good shape. Flavors of plum and cassis have a strong vanilla and oak resin accent, while the finish is tannic, roasted and robust.",88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Baked and broad on the nose, with toasty aromas, marshmallow sweetness and floral hints. The palate is tight, healthy and tastes of savory, meaty fruit including black cherry and wild raspberry. Leather and herbal notes work the finish, and overall this is nice but more basic than complex.",87,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,4.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Broquel always offers a little more elegance and pedigree than most value Malbecs, and the 2005 has body, a silky feel and aromas and flavors of tobacco, baked blackberries and leather. It's a ripe, moderately tannic wine that's best for near-term drinking.",88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2005,8.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Dark but reduced aromas of tire and blackberry set up a muscular palate with pinching tannins. Roasted, oaky flavors of spicy berry, clove and cocoa finish with a final woody note and choppy toughness.",88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"For several vintages running Broquel has nudged the border between very good and excellent, but as in years past the '06 is a touch tangy and racy, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. It's bold, zippy and quite high-toned, but still it's very competent and held together.",89,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Minty and toasty upfront, this is layered with blackberry, licorice, leather and toast aromas. It feels raring and ready to go, courtesy of firm acidity and good overall framing. Flavors of wild berry are bright, with herb and oak accents. Long, toasty and solid on the finish.",91,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Minty blackberry aromas come with a giant scoop of oak and a touch of graphite. This is lively, ripe and a touch acidic, with dark-fruit flavors and freshness courtesy of ringing acids. The finish shows size and moderate sophistication.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Cola, blackberry and dusty aromas amount to something nice and inviting. Cab Franc is new to the Broquel lineup, and this is lush, bold and fruity in style, with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors in front of a toasty, full-throttle finish.",90,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,19.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,2.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,2.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Waxy aromas suggest haystack and dusty apple. This is on the borderline of heavy and cloying in the mouth, while oak is the main driver of the flavor profile. On the finish, notes of melon and banana are covered by a resiny oak flavor.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,2.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Baked apple, toast, spun sugar and fresh summer corn aromas are appealing and totally New World, while the palate is tropical in flavor and racy in feel. An example of acidity and ripe fruit working together to create a tasty but ripe-styled Chardonnay. Drink now.",88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,2.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Grassy, green aromas are dull and fruitless. The palate is citric at first but then it collapses. Flavors of citrus and tarragon finish bland and with vegetal leanings.",82,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,2.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to Torrontés, while green herb and lime notes stir things up.",89,15.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2011,37.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Lime and floral notes create a light and breezy bouquet that's easygoing. In the mouth, it's juicy and fresh, with lemon-lime, peach, nectarine and lychee flavors. Tangy and fresh on the finish, and more precise and delicate than most Argentinean Torrontés.",88,15.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2010,37.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"This is Torrontes in its pure, true form. Trapiche has captured the light, floral essence of the grape and wrapped it in an oily but smooth package that houses lovely green apple and papaya flavors. With structure, flavor and balance, this wine will go well with a wide range of summer foods.",88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,37.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"Tropical fruit and citrus aromas turn toward air freshener and bath soap upon airing. This feels standard for Torrontés, maybe even a bit flabby, with lychee and melon flavors that finish chalky.",85,15.0,Other,Cafayate,Michael Schachner,2012,37.0,Broquel,Trapiche
Argentina,"This is lightly perfumed with green melon, lychee and papaya aromas. The palate is middle of the road in terms of acidity and snap.

Argentina,"Spice and dusty fruit aromas are equalized by saucy, funky, leafy notes. This is full in the mouth, with flavors of brown sugar, baking spices and baked cherry. This finishes with mild spice and oak flavors.",84,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,1.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Grassy stalky berry aromas lean towards green. This feels grippy, while spicy herbal berry flavors stay the course and finish with minty green notes on top of basic plum and berry.",84,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout.",88,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"After whiffs of burnt rubber and char blow off, this berry-packed Cabernet hits like a small brick with black fruit flavor, which packs punch and aftershocks of cocoa and coffee. Chunky, rough and warm.",85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,4.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Generic red-fruit aromas are accented by sage and thyme, while in the mouth the feel is wiry. Full-blooded raspberry and cherry flavors come with pronounced acidity and lighter-framed tannins, so there's some sharpness. All in all it's a no-frills red wine with minimal Cabernet character.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Mellow but friendly berry aromas feed into a firm palate with tight red-fruit tannins and then ripe flavors of blackberry and chocolate cake. The finish is toasty, with a chocolate mint-chip note and acidic snap.",87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. A clean, straightforward wine with zest but limited flavors.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,4.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy.",85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet. It's thick and saturated but balanced, with harmonious, easy to like flavors of blackberry and cassis.

Argentina,"Black and charred at first, with licorice, asphalt and a touch of bacon on the bouquet. The palate is soft, soupy and round, with ripe, saturated berry and fig flavors. Finishes spicy and full, with chewy tannins and ample extract.",87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche

Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",86,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,2.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Toasty but dull, with oily walnut aromas matched by stale fruit. This is heavy and baked out; sweet and flat as a board.",81,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,2.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Fleshy peach and melon aromas comme off as chunky and soft. The palate is just as soft as the nose, with melon and banana flavors. A simple finish is friendly but lacks spine, so drink this Chardonnay before it loses steam.",84,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,2.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Warm and honeyed Chardonnay with toast and melon aromas. The body is big but the acidity is staunch enough to keep things moving. Flavors of toast and coconut sweeten up apple and melon fruit, and the finish is lasting.",86,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,2.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.",85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,2.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"After light scents of butter and spiced apple surface, the wine turns briny and pickled, both in aromas and flavors. It feels fleshy on the finish, with briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors.",82,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,2.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.",88,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,6.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's “oak cask” labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum. A toasty, charred finish is lifted by bright acidity and fresh black-fruit flavors. This will go well with just about anything off the grill.",88,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,6.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,6.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean.",85,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,6.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Bright and bold to the eye, this has generous, powerful berry aromas that come with a note of spice. It feels stacked and only slightly tangy, with black fruit and some of Syrah's more textbook flavors of leather and animal. It holds form on the finish.",87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,6.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.",86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2005,6.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Tight and intense for a $10 varietal, with crusty, charred oak aromas on top of ripe berry fruit.

Vanilla and mocha work the woody finish.",86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,6.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
Argentina,"Although Argentina is hardly Pinot Grigio country, this is a tropical-style quaffer with good balance and enough acidity to avoid coming across heavy. Creamy aromas of melon and lychee set up flavors of nectarine and tangerine. A lasting but modest finish is fair and appropriate.",85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,36.0,Oak Cask,Trapiche
US,"Though this wine was aged in just 26% new oak (French and American), the wood makes the first impression. Aromas of caramel, coffee and vanilla extract fare are followed by dark fruit and spices. Flavors are rich, hedonistic and sweet, supported by firm, somewhat rustic tannins.",89,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2011,10.0,Reserve,Castillo De Feliciana

US,"The oak (two-thirds new French and American) leads, with aromas of cocoa, cinnamon and spice followed by plum. The palate shows an elegant styling but with good intensity to the flavors.",89,45.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,8.0,Estate Vineyard,Castillo De Feliciana
US,"The aromas of flowers and freshly cut pear, melon and starfruit are bright and fresh. This wine is dry and thick in feel with abundant citrus-rind flavors. There's enjoyment to be had but it gets bogged down in the middle.",87,24.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,35.0,Estate Vineyard,Castillo De Feliciana
US,"Made from 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, spice-tinged fruit aromas and toasted baguette complexity make a grand entrance on the nose. It then gushes bold and complex flavors, like toasted walnuts and almonds, poached pears and a touch of ginger. Although big and broad in flavor for a sparkling wine, it's very well structured and a good bet to age through 2022 or longer.",96,120.0,California,North Coast,Jim Gordon,2007,21.0,Reserve,Schramsberg
US,"An especially deep-gold color and enticing, expansive aromas indicate the extra aging time this Pinot Noir-based bubbly went through. Ripe pear, honey and toasted-almond notes weave across the palate as a rich mouthfeel is picked up by fine yet persistent bubbles. It is a delicious, mature wine that shows how complex and rewarding California sparkling wine can be with time. Keep through 2022.",95,120.0,California,North Coast,Jim Gordon,2008,21.0,Reserve,Schramsberg
US,"This compelling and delicious bottling has a grand bearing, sophisticated flavors and elegant texture, like something the staff at Downton Abbey would serve.

US,"This lively, crisp and tantalizing wine emphasizes fresh green apple aromas, vivid citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit, and a rather full body from energetic bubbles.

It does just what a brut style is supposed to in terms of refreshment and lip-smacking flavors.",92,70.0,California,Anderson Valley,Jim Gordon,2010,27.0,Brut,Schramsberg
US,"Bracing and bright, this shows definite Chardonnay characteristics, such as a buttery, apple pie aroma and vivid crisp apple and lemon flavors. Nothing is overblown, though, so it retains finesse.

US,"This wine has that warm, spicy, friendly feel of new oak that is well integrated with the fruit flavors, and a velvety texture to match.

It's so easy to enjoy.",91,32.0,California,Amador County,Jim Gordon,2013,31.0,Reserve,Fiddletown Cellars
US,"At just 12.5% alcohol, this comes across as dry and quite fresh, with vivid grapefruit flesh and acidity. Some mint and lemon flavors sneak in also.

US,"An off-dry, leesy, delicately floral Riesling, this elegantly captures the floral and mineral qualities that make the grape so exceptional. The wine doesn't push too hard, but it persists, mixing white peach and papaya with citrus blossom, rosewater and body powder. Exotic and delightful.",90,12.0,Washington,Washington,Paul Gregutt,2006,7.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"Though technically off-dry, this tastes tart and racy, following its lively aromatics with crisp citrus-fruit flavors of Key lime, Satsuma orange, and ripe apricots. The fruit sources—Evergreen and Wahluke Slope vineyards—are among the best in Washington for Riesling.",90,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,7.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"This is quite light and lemony, closer to an Italian Pinot Grigio than to an Oregon Pinot Gris. What it lacks in flesh it compensates for in freshness and vitality; the subtle fruit flavors suggest Asian pear, jicama and cucumber. It would be a lovely match for a light fish such as rainbow trout or Dover sole.",87,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,18.0,Traditions,Milbrandt

US,"This was a cool, acidic vintage, and this has a fairly strong herbal streak, along with broad flavors of vanilla and tobacco. The Cabernet fruit falls a bit short of fully ripe, and the oak treatment does not completely mask the bitterness.",85,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,4.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.",90,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,4.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"The aromas bring notes of toasty spices, black currant, green pepper and blue fruit. The fruit and smoke flavors are smooth and easy drinking, with lightly grainy tannins providing support.

US,"Coming from vineyards scattered across the Wahluke Slope, this immediately charming wine has aromas of mocha, coffee, plum, herbs and assorted barrel spices. The sweet blue fruit flavors are soft and bring plenty of appeal.",88,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"Heavy flavors of vanilla syrup coat the tongue, obscuring the fruit but not quite hiding the green tannins. Though such flavors are not unusual in many inexpensive Merlots, it's a little disappointing from a grower with such excellent fruit to work with.",84,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,17.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"Coffee, smoke, herb, blue-fruit and barrel-spice aromas are at the fore. The palate provides soft, easy-drinking fruit and barrel flavors that linger.",87,17.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,17.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"From a mix of Milbrandt vineyard sites, this outstanding blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Syrah, Malbec and Barbera. The blend was so well done that each component adds a vital piece to the whole—smooth berry and cherry fruits, spice, tobacco, licorice and smoke, folding into a lush and chocolaty finish.",90,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,17.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"Full and fruity, ripe and round, this value-priced Merlot is done in a surprisingly lush style. Perfectly ripe, clean flavors are backed by smooth tannins.

US,"Aromas of crème brûlée, apple, vanilla and spice lead to broad-feeling fruit flavors speckled with barrel accents. It's a very pleasing, well-priced offering of the variety.",89,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2015,2.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"Clean, fresh and simple, this does not claim to be “unoaked” but it carries that style in its flavors, a snappy mix of green apple, pineapple and grapefruit. Good everyday drinking.",87,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,2.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"Despite its unusual, five-grape blend, this is a well-balanced rosé with a fruity mix of cranberry, cherry, raspberry and watermelon flavors. It's light, forward, a little on the soda pop side, but quite nice for sipping or accompanying something as substantial as your holiday turkey.",86,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,9.0,Traditions,Milbrandt
US,"This wine hews to the Milbrandt style, emphasizing notes of vanilla and tobacco ahead of the simple black-fruit flavor. It has a hint of smoky earthiness and a citrusy edge to the acids.",87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,6.0,Traditions,Milbrandt

The body is fruity but dry.",90,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,7.0,Vieilles Vignes,Domaine Charles Frey
France,"Straw gold in color, this is a fragrant, delicately aromatic wine. Made from organic fruit, it has pure white fruit and mineral flavors that are cut with intense youthful acidity.

France,"The nose is subdued but has a floral aspect. The palate, while fresh, slender and dry, seems to have a bitter element that gets in the way of the clean citrus notes. There is some concentration and a zesty lemony finish.",87,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2016,7.0,Vieilles Vignes,Domaine G. Metz
France,"While there is ample pear fruit on nose and palate, bitter pith notes seem to be dominant. Alcoholic heat is palpable on the midpalate. The finish is dry and returns to the fruity pear notes.",87,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2016,18.0,Vieilles Vignes,Domaine G. Metz
France,"The nose is a subdued but evocative blend of rose petal, peach, lemon and mirabelle. The palate shows a similarly easy interplay of flavors on a concentrated, harmonious and off-dry body. This is fresh and fruity, lively and enticing.",90,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,23.0,Vieilles Vignes,Domaine G. Metz
France,"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness. Judicious wood aging has rounded the wine out while leaving all its fruit intact. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.",86,30.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,Roger Voss,2012,1.0,Vieilles Vignes,Manuel Olivier
France,"There is a depth of flavor and concentration from low-yield old vines. The style gives raspberry flavors and acidity, with a light tannic character.",85,19.0,Burgundy,Hautes Côtes de Nuits,Roger Voss,2008,1.0,Vieilles Vignes,Manuel Olivier

France,"While this wine certainly has a tannic background, it is already showing fruitiness and ripe berry and red plum flavors. That makes for a warm, rounded wine that will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2016.",88,80.0,Burgundy,Pommard,Roger Voss,2011,1.0,Premier Cru,Manuel Olivier
France,"There is a sense of extraction and long wood aging with this bitter, chocolate-flavored wine. The palate has a dark plum-skin fruit character and a dry, hard-edged core. It will need at least six years to mature.",89,71.0,Burgundy,Pommard,Roger Voss,2010,1.0,Premier Cru,Manuel Olivier
France,"This firm wine fits well with the image of Pommard. A tannic core contrasts with the potential of the red cherry fruits. Wood aging is still prominent, and the wine needs time to balance out. Drink from 2017.",89,80.0,Burgundy,Pommard,Roger Voss,2012,1.0,Premier Cru,Manuel Olivier
France,"This is a blend of grapes from a number of Premier Cru parcels. It gives a rich, ripe and fruity wine with a good depth of flavor and strong signs of the wood aging.

France,"Smooth and rich, this wine is made from fruit that's sourced from 65-year-old vines. It has fresh acidity that gives a bright quality to the ripe fruit.

France,"Round and full-bodied, the wine is dominated by wood-aging flavors.

France,"When T-L gets the mix of fruit and oak right, the wines can be deliciously hedonistic.

Drink 2012–2020.",91,35.0,Rhône Valley,Crozes-Hermitage,Joe Czerwinski,2008,6.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"T-L's 2007s from the Northern Rhône came out well, including this example from Saint-Joseph. Intense espresso, cracked pepper and black olive notes scream of cool-climate Syrah, while the feel in the mouth is supple, ending on a silky note.",91,46.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Joseph,Joe Czerwinski,2007,6.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?",92,91.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Joe Czerwinski,2013,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"This is a rugged, firmly tannic rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that requires time in the cellar to reach its full potential. That said, it may also pose a risk, because there are hints of Band-Aid on the nose and a slightly metallic edge to the finish that may worsen over time. The other flavors are potent and concentrated: plum, chocolate and licorice all leave lasting impressions on the palate. Try after 2016.",92,77.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Joe Czerwinski,2009,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"The poster child for Tardieu's winemaking style is this 2009 Rasteau. It features masses of luscious oak—toasted coconut, cedar, vanilla—with just enough raspberry fruit to support it. It's full bodied and lushly textured, even a bit dessert-like despite being totally dry. Probably best consumed on its own over the next few years.",92,31.0,Rhône Valley,Rasteau,Joe Czerwinski,2009,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"In this case, Tardieu-Laurent's distinctive oak signature is amply supported by layers of black cherry and raspberry fruit. Hickory smoke and dusty tannins frame the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2020–2030.",93,51.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,Joe Czerwinski,2013,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"Like oak? Yes? Then this is the Vacqueyras for you.

Drink now–2018.",91,45.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,Joe Czerwinski,2010,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"The only question with this wine is whether it might be too much of a good thing. It's full bodieed and densely concentrated, with oaky notes of toasted almond and vanilla layered over plummy fruit, finishing warm and lush. Hedonistic to the max. Drink now.",92,77.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Joe Czerwinski,2008,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"The impression of richness and density extends even to the nose of this wine, which suggests fruitcake and spice cake. It's full-bodied and velvety, offering an array of flavors ranging from cedar and vanilla through to cherries and chocolate. Sure it's oaky, but darn tasty, too. Drink 2020–2030.",92,47.0,Rhône Valley,Vacqueyras,Joe Czerwinski,2013,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"Oak aging remains a hallmark of the Tardieu-Laurent style, but it seems to fit with the 2010s from Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Toasted coconut, vanilla and plum pudding notes work together to give almost the impression of dessert in a glass, despite the wine's dry nature. It's full bodied, richly textured and slightly warm on the finish yet surprisingly elegant. Drink now–2020.",92,75.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Joe Czerwinski,2010,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"While some cuvées seem to handle the oak better than others, this wine comes across as full of toasted coconut and vanilla. There's some dark cherry fruit and savory herbs in support, but the oak dominates, albeit it in a popular, user-friendly way.",89,51.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,Joe Czerwinski,2012,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"This wine epitomizes the lush ripeness of the 2009 vintage, yet does so without going over the top into dried fruit. Instead, it delivers brandied cherries spiced with cinnamon and clove, plus a touch of chocolate. It's full bodied and maybe just a bit warm, but the long finish is textured like fine suede. Drink now–2020.",92,42.0,Rhône Valley,Vacqueyras,Joe Czerwinski,2009,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"Despite incredible levels of ripeness—evidenced by notes of chocolate and dried fruit—this wine features a bit of garrigue on the nose and licorice flavors on the palate, which together impart a sense of freshness. Full bodied and richly textured, it ends in a silky dusting of cocoa powder-like tannins. Drink now–2020.",92,44.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,Joe Czerwinski,2009,15.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"Rich and broad in the mouth, with notes of honeyed citrus reminiscent of tangerine and a tang of peppery spice. The finish is warm, spicy and long, with a hint of vanilla oak.

France,"Full-bodied, rich and unctuous, this is an exotic, flamboyant white Châteauneuf-du-Pape for drinking over the next year. Grilled pineapple is drizzled with caramel and cinnamon, wrapping up long and lush.",94,66.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Joe Czerwinski,2014,28.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"This intriguing wine displays an almost fumé-style smoky minerality on the nose, followed by flavors of pear and toast. It's a focused, medium-bodied blend of 50% Marsanne and 50% Roussanne, with a finish that won't quit.",90,32.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Péray,Joe Czerwinski,2007,28.0,Vieilles Vignes,Tardieu-Laurent

France,"Very aromatic, gentle, almost floral notes of Cox's Orange Pippin appear with the first whiff. They get their full due on the off-dry palate which boosts the fruit flavors and paints them in a golden light. There is grip and backbone and ample fruit. Drink while the fruit is at its height: 2016–2018. Finishes off dry.",89,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2012,7.0,Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,Domaine de la Tour Blanche
France,Blossom and citrus inform the nose—white jasmine hovers alongside grapefruit and orange. The palate is juicy and full of bouncy easy fruit on a fluid dryish body. Bright lemon freshness makes the fruit flavors even more vivid. The balance between fruit and freshness gives this tension and makes it very moreish. The finish is clean and orange scented.,92,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,7.0,Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,Domaine de la Tour Blanche

US,"This is a classically light rosé, fragrant in strawberry and raspberry. Traces of pomegranate on the back palate offers darker, riper fruit in the glass, getting prettier as it goes along. Deliciously dry and dancing in acidity, it has plenty of citrus on the finish.

France,"Soft, dainty scents of pressed sweet pea, white raspberry and cherry dance in the bouquet, while pithy citrus and cherry-skin flavors unfold on the palate.

US,"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style. A firm coating of fine tannins gives grip on the tongue and seems to extend the juicy fruit and dark chocolate notes on the finish.",92,22.0,California,Contra Costa County,Jim Gordon,2013,13.0,Old Vines,Three

Spain,"Deep and earthy smelling, with meatiness, black fruit and hickory notes to the bouquet.

Spain,"The bouquet on this Garnacha is mildly raisiny, with cola, mint and medicinal accents.

The moderate alcohol makes it an ideal summer sipper.",88,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,7.0,Estate Vineyards,Jones of Washington
US,"This is the best Pinot Gris yet from Jones; the grapes were sourced from the 2 Gun Vineyard in the upcoming Ancient Lakes region—a future American Viticultural Area.

A well polished wine.",90,50.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Matt Kettmann,2014,2.0,Estate Vineyards,Grevino

Best after 2020.",89,60.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Estate Vineyards,Pepper Bridge

US,"Aromatic with crushed rock, raspberry, cranberry and hints of clove, this well-structured wine—53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot—will reward additional bottle age.

US,"Right on the heels of the excellent 2008, this estate-grown Bordeaux-style blend is equally compelling. Bright and tasty fruit flavors of blueberry and black cherry introduce a lively, polished wine with a firm, complex and layered structure. Seventeen months in French oak, roughly half new, has wrapped the fruit in a nicely-layered, textural finish with highlights of mineral, licorice, black olive and spice.",93,60.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,5.0,Seven Hills Vineyard,Pepper Bridge
US,"This compelling blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (49%), Merlot (27%), Cabernet Franc (19%) and Petit Verdot provides aromas of coffee, mocha, sautéed herbs, cherry and woodspice. The flavors are rich and focused, backed by chewy, slightly dry tannins.

It sits squarely in the classic mold of the better Walla Walla Syrahs.",91,28.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Tertulia
US,"The Tempranillo has an agreeable entry, with pretty violet scents leading into tart raspberry and cherry fruit, amplified with a bit of barrel spice.

US,"From 41-year-old vines on just over five estate acres, this is resiny and briny on the nose. A honey-laced creaminess at the core is tensely accentuated by vibrant acidity.

US,"From the producer's dry-farmed mountain vineyard, this wine is crafted from vines planted some 40 years ago.

The acidity is bright, uplifting and lush enough to find complete balance.",92,32.0,California,Spring Mountain District,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Estate Bottled,Smith-Madrone
US,"Yet another example of where a producer's slightly cheaper appellation blends are just as stunning as the single-vineyard expressions. Steve Dooley's bottling offers black sage, dried tarragon, fennel, beet juice, cranberry, Earl Grey tea and smoked game on the nose. The palate shows smoked pork with a black-cherry rub, a touch of pencil lead and an intriguing red-sumac flavor.",94,32.0,California,Edna Valley,Matt Kettmann,2014,1.0,Estate Bottled,Stephen Ross
US,"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",91,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Matt Kettmann,2015,1.0,Rosé of,Stephen Ross

US,"Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley.

The texture is compelling.",89,42.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Matt Kettmann,2015,2.0,Bien Nacido Vineyard,Stephen Ross
US,"Mexican lime, crushed chalk, light jasmine, daffodil and lemon-lime soda show on the nose of this bottling by veteran Steve Dooley. Tight cement and lime-rind flavors pop on the palate, where a sharp kumquat quality dissects the Bosc-pear warmth and the nuanced influence of damp dill and other green herbs.",93,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Matt Kettmann,2014,2.0,Bien Nacido Vineyard,Stephen Ross
US,"The veteran San Luis Obispo-based winemaker heads south to the historic vineyard to produce this wine.

US,"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard behind the winery in the western shade of Oakville, this wine opens with charred oak and a smoky, meaty character that intrigues. Seamless on the palate in soft, perceptible tannin, it delves into characteristics of cedar and brushy sage as it goes, unveiling a wildness that's hard to contain. Its bright, fresh finish gives it a roundness that's ready to enjoy now.",95,155.0,California,Oakville,Virginie Boone,2013,4.0,Estate Bottled,Far Niente
US,"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard, this is a supple, soft wine, with refined tannins.

US,"The addition of 5% Sémillon proves to be the right call in this white, a structured, spritzy glass of tree-ripened apricot and exotic lemongrass with a pleasant heft to the palate. A twist of ripeness gives a mouthwatering, juicy finish.",90,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,12.0,Estate Bottled,Spring Mountain Vineyard
US,"Fermented in neutral French oak and kept light and bright, this wine is sourced from two high-elevation vineyards (both estate) above the producer's winery, including La Perla at 1,100 feet.

Will go well with steak.",88,45.0,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,Michael Schachner,2003,4.0,Estate Bottled,Marques de Griñon
Spain,"Dark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah. Good with bacon burgers, steak off the grill, etc.",88,45.0,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,Michael Schachner,2003,6.0,Estate Bottled,Marques de Griñon
Spain,"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.",87,45.0,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,Michael Schachner,2003,43.0,Estate Bottled,Marques de Griñon
Spain,"The winery spells it Petite Verdot, and the wine shows tight aromas of black fruits, leather and mushroom. The palate is deep and very ripe, with full-force blueberry and blackberry flavors. A little edgy and tannic, but immensely ripe and pleasant, just like all the Marqués de Griñon 2004s. Good now and better in 2009–10.",91,45.0,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,Michael Schachner,2004,43.0,Estate Bottled,Marques de Griñon
Argentina,"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Estate Bottled,Finca El Portillo
Argentina,"Fairly round aromas of blackberry are also slightly grapey, while the plump palate offers dark fruit flavors and a choppy mouthfeel.

Argentina,"Licorice and warm blacktop make for a dark nose, yet there isn't much base to the acidic palate. There's grabby, tangy generic fruit but mostly tartness and sizzle. An edgy wine with a spot of mocha on a sharp finish.",82,11.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2006,17.0,Estate Bottled,Finca El Portillo
Argentina,"Pungent with true Sauvignon character. Tangerine, green fruits and grapefruit share the flavor profile, and the finish is mild but clean. Zesty, straightforward and tasty if served chilled.",85,11.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2007,12.0,Estate Bottled,Finca El Portillo
Argentina,"Honest Sauvignon aromas of citrus and grapefruit set out the welcome mat.

Argentina,"A little dusty and also sort of briney on the nose, with citric acidity pushing orange, apple and pear flavors.

Argentina,"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame. A mild, innocuous wine if there ever was one. Drink as soon as possible.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2007,2.0,Estate Bottled,Finca El Portillo
US,"Well-modulated fruit and spice flavors rest on a moderately tannic and velvety texture, giving this dry wine a suave feel despite being full bodied.

US,"A rosé of Tempranillo, with Syrah and Malbec blended in, Matchbook always offers good value on its wines, with this one basic and simple in its ripe raspberry and jasmine qualities. Drink cold.",84,12.0,California,Dunnigan Hills,Virginie Boone,2012,9.0,Estate Bottled,Matchbook
Argentina,"Spicy red-plum aromas are dry and gritty, but fresh. This firm feeling Cab holds its own on the palate, which is tannic and a bit sandpapery. Tight, juicy flavors of spicy plum finish long, dry and mildly salty tasting.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Estate Bottled,Bodega Carmine Granata
Argentina,"This opens with off-putting aromas of cinnamon and air freshener. On the palate, this is chewy and creamy, with a ton of oak and jammy, baked berry flavors that finish sticky.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Estate Bottled,Bodega Carmine Granata
Argentina,"Chewing gum dust, red plum and cherry aromas define the bouquet on this racy, slightly abrasive feeling Malbec. Things taste short and snappy, with red fruit flavors backed by peppery dryness.",84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Estate Bottled,Bodega Carmine Granata
Spain,"Gritty cherry and cranberry aromas and a bright red color announce a spunky, simple wine with little Cabernet character. Juicy and light-bodied, it conveys basic plum and cherry flavors.",83,5.0,Levante,Yecla,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Estate Bottled,Terrenal
Argentina,"Candied plum and red berry aromas smell like red licorice. Flavors are raisiny, with sourness and astringency.",80,5.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Estate Bottled,Terrenal
Spain,"Light plum and red-berry aromas lead to a racy, fresh palate with little body or structure. Candied raspberry and plum flavors are fresh but don't change or improve on the finish.",83,5.0,Levante,Yecla,Michael Schachner,2012,10.0,Estate Bottled,Terrenal
Spain,"Nice on the nose, this has a leafy note and a mellow red-berry aroma. Bouncy and rubbery feeling, it has easygoing flavors of raspberry and plum. It's candied and rubbery tasting on the finish, but good overall.",84,4.0,Levante,Yecla,Michael Schachner,2010,10.0,Estate Bottled,Terrenal
US,"This engaging, full-bodied and densely textured wine has a great bouquet and structured yet fine-grained tannins. It exudes an engaging mix of spices, smoke and cedar in the aroma, and serves equally layered and complex fruit and spice flavors. Best after 2018.",91,30.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2013,4.0,Estate Bottled,Cedarville

US,"This wine has the complete butter and baking-spice treatment from barrel fermentation to make it rich in aromatics and full and creamy in texture. It has a light tangerine and cream aroma, rich fruit and baking-spice flavors and a lingering finish.",92,22.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2014,25.0,Estate Bottled,Cedarville
US,"An aroma like charcoal and fennel leads to concentrated smoke and black-pepper flavors and a taut, tannic texture before more generous nuances like black cherry and savory lentils kick in. It's a fascinating wine that develops more layers and complexity as it breathes. Best after 2019.",92,29.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2013,6.0,Estate Bottled,Cedarville
US,"Rich in body but light in tannins, this warm, generous wine fills the mouth and eases down the throat. It has a good mélange of cherry, strawberry and floral aromas, satisfying fruit flavors and a nicely soft finish.",89,25.0,California,El Dorado,Jim Gordon,2013,26.0,Estate Bottled,Cedarville

Argentina,"This is floral and candied upfront, with a red licorice note. It feels full and fleshy, with hints of red berry and cassis, with not too much oak on the palate. Ripe, basic, clean and sweet as a whole.",87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"This oaky number offers enough meaty fruit to keep itself on an even keel. Gritty berry and sawdust aromas lead to a full-bodied, resiny palate. Woody, drying flavors rest heavily atop a core of medicinal, herbal berry fruit. It's ripe and resiny on the finish, which is consistent with what came beforehand.",87,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"Big, fresh, grapy aromas are the greeting on this nice but generic Malbec. The palate is plump and chunky yet bright and fruit-forward, with creamy flavors of dark plum and berry. A clean, focused, short finish functions as a good close.",87,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"Choppy plum and berry aromas are mildly raw and herbaceous, but not overly so. Round and standard in feel, this Malbec tastes of creamy, herbal berry fruits that turn slightly green and oaky. Peppery, medicinal, herbal flavors drive the finish.",86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2015,8.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"Mild lemon and apple aromas are compromised by a harsh, stalky element. The mouthfeel is basic and spritzy, while generic apple and green melon flavors end in tropical sweetness.",83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,12.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"Flat to start, with oaky aromas of mustard and clove, this feels round, with citric acidity and a sense of wood grain to the palate. Barrel-driven flavors of salty melon and mustard end with grainy resiny oak notes.",84,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2015,2.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,Heavy oak scents create a popcorn nose that leads to flabby flavors of peach and melon. The wine is woody and simple.,83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,2.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"Aromas of matchstick, crushed vitamin and white fruits feed into a lean, hollow palate with surface-level oak. Lemon and oak are the key flavors, while this tastes oaky but feels rather watery on a light finish.",86,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2016,2.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"This is not a consistent wine year to year. Some vintages are true and vital, but this is clunky, with flavors of honeyed white fruits and bitter almond skins.",81,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,37.0,Estate Bottled,Pascual Toso
Argentina,"Toso's first-ever rosé of Malbec comes in a salmon color, with clean but generic aromas of melon, cotton candy and wet stones.

Argentina,"Light, transparent and candied with underdeveloped, boring flavors and a mild chemical harshness. Barely worth a look. 40,000 cases produced.",80,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Estate Bottled,Rio Seco
Argentina,"Overdone aromas of candle wax, incense and air freshener show the musky side of the grape, while the palate is heavy with nectarine and citrus flavors. Finishes a little pithy and mealy, with a final wave of muskiness.",83,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,37.0,Estate Bottled,Rio Seco
Argentina,"Red-fruit aromas carry a distinct citric edge, while the palate is made up of sweet cassis and cherry flavors along with an incongruent orange essence. The feel is a bit hard and pedestrian, while the finish is quick and ordinary at best.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Reserva,Rio Seco
US,"John Chiarito is the first American to petition for the right to label his wine Nero d'Avola, a variety he grows just outside of the town of Ukiah in eastern Mendocino and a nod to his family's Southern Italian heritage (the grape is native to Sicily). Here he's made an outstandingly intriguing, rustic, big fruit, high-acid red that'll surprise you as it opens, very Old World and definitely worth a try if you can find it. Only 60 cases produced.",91,36.0,California,Mendocino,Virginie Boone,2007,41.0,Estate Bottled,Chiarito
US,"Juicy as a dark plum with a raspberry chaser, this 80-case Petite Sirah gets better and better as it opens, revealing itself to be mellow and rustic, yet big and broad-shouldered. It would make the perfect pairing with a plate of cheesy pasta, meat sauce and crusty garlic bread, or anything with pancetta.",91,30.0,California,Mendocino,Virginie Boone,2007,29.0,Estate Bottled,Chiarito
US,"John Chiarito is making Italian varieties like Nero d'Avola and Negro Amaro––as well as estate-grown Petite Sirah and Zinfandel––on the outskirts of Ukiah, from his basement winery. There he combines an Old-World sensibility with New World techniques. He's nailing it here with a rustic, tannic but intensely delicious Zin full of berry aromas and a spicy finish. Big and hearty, this wine has soul.",92,21.0,California,Mendocino,Virginie Boone,2007,13.0,Estate Bottled,Chiarito

US,"The Amador Zin specialist is offering its first ever Grenache here, a tremendous debut, super light in color and texture, lightly rendered to show off its layers of delicate violet and raspberry amid a meatier backbone of lurking anise and herbs. With 9% Mourvedre and 5% Syrah, this is a light red worth seeking out.",89,20.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Virginie Boone,2011,26.0,Estate Bottled,Amador Foothill Winery
US,"This full-bodied wine has a rather light color. Aromas seem roasted and savory rather than fruity, leading to attractive spicy, meaty, almost mushroomy flavors.

US,"This wine has a big personality. It's dark in color and oozing with ripe black-cherry flavors that intermingle with a high level of tannin for that lip-smacking tooth-staining effect. So approach with caution, and then enjoy for all its boisterous impact.",91,30.0,California,Kelsey Bench-Lake County,Jim Gordon,2013,45.0,Estate Bottled,Prima Materia
US,"Showing great restraint and structure, this wine is complex, savory and brings a welcome change from the usual fruity soft California wine. It smells lightly spicy, beefy and earthy, tastes mild but deep, with fascinating flavors like smoked meat, tea, raspberry and cola.",92,28.0,California,Kelsey Bench-Lake County,Jim Gordon,2014,11.0,Estate Bottled,Prima Materia
US,"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs.

US,"A showy, exuberant wine, from the hot pink color to the fresh, jammy aromas to the just-sweet finish. However, it feels soft in texture and body, with mild cherry-candy and peach flavors.",86,14.0,California,Mendocino,Jim Gordon,2013,9.0,Estate Bottled,Bliss
US,"This is a rather big and rich wine that has a deep orange-pink color, along with quite a bit of body and red-fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth, as plum and melon flavors meet soft acidity. It's more like a red wine than most of today's rosés, but is a pleasure to drink.",89,14.0,California,Mendocino,Jim Gordon,2016,9.0,Estate Bottled,Bliss
US,"Bursting with fruity aromas of peaches, peach ring candies and orange blossom, this is a fresh wine. Juicy mango and more peach unfold on the palate.

US,"Fragrant aromas of green pear and apple mix with a riper peach note on the nose. With 10% aged in French oak, this Chardonnay trends toward the unoaked style—light bodied, crisp and fruit-forward.

Spain,"There is no indication on the bottle what this blend might be. Regardless of composition, it's a generic, solid wine with melon and vanilla cookie aromas backed by a round, citrusy mouthfeel. Flavors of briny citrus and white grapefruit finish decently.",85,11.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Michael Schachner,2013,14.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Paso a Paso

Spain,"Big black-fruit aromas of plum and wild berry get this young Tempranillo off to a good start.

Spain,"Grassy, compost-like aromas carry a peanut accent and not much vivid fruit.

US,"Old vine Pinot Gris? Sourced from the Jacob Hart vineyard, it's about 20 years old. Lightly beery, yeasty, with Asian pear and buttered apple providing the main flavor interest.

US,"Shea shows some muscle here, yet remains fruit-driven, with a lush midpalate mixing strawberry and raspberry fruit with cola/sassafras soda flavors. In keeping with Boedecker's style, this wine is extremely clean, the fruit is fresh and the flavors nicely detailed. Nothing big or over the top here, but first-class winemaking.",90,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Boedecker Cellars
US,"Shea, as always, is a full-bodied, fruit-driven Pinot with a broad midpalate showing blackberry fruit and citrusy acids. It falls away rather quickly, leaving a stony impression, but is missing the concentration of Shea bottlings from other vintners.",88,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2005,1.0,Shea Vineyard,Boedecker Cellars
US,"This is a keeper. Smoky, charred aromas, rich dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and boysenberry and meaty, peppery accents fill up this full-bodied and very firmly textured wine. It will get even more interesting with age; try it after 2020.",91,35.0,California,Contra Costa County,Jim Gordon,2013,29.0,Old Vine,Trinitas
US,"This is a linebacker wine, at 15.7% abv, bursting with roasted coffee, licorice and dry tannins all around. Soft, supple and round, and fully concentrated, the finish could use a bit more harrumph. The back label's suggestion to pair this wine with short ribs is a good call.",86,35.0,California,Contra Costa County,Virginie Boone,2010,29.0,Old Vine,Trinitas

US,"This all-out Zin makes no bones about its sweetness, heavy oak spiciness and full body.

Very rich and full-bodied, it has prominent caramelized oak notes that keep the tannins from biting.",87,16.0,California,Lodi,Jim Gordon,2011,13.0,Old Vine,Seven Deadly Zins
US,"This has an unusually dark color. Aromas of blackberry jam and maple syrup are followed by equally rich, deep and expressive flavors. The remarkable concentration of ripe berry flavors layered densely with fine tannins is at least partly due to blending in Petite Sirah. It adds up to a full bodied and delicious wine.",91,16.0,California,Lodi,Jim Gordon,2012,13.0,Old Vine,Seven Deadly Zins
US,"This full-bodied wine has a deep color and smoke and charcoal aromas. The flavors are ripe, concentrated, grapy and berry-like. The texture has moderate tannins but is polished around the edges.

US,"Juicy, plummy and dusty, in well-integrated ways, this is a classically earthy old-vine Zin, with plush blueberry and blackberry on the palate that finishes rich in mocha and cinnamon. Medium in body and acidity, it's approachable and enjoyable now.",90,38.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2012,13.0,Old Vine,Seghesio

US,"Old-vine Oregon Zinfandel is not common; in fact, this is all of them. From the Pines Vineyard, planted around a century ago, revived in the 1980s, these wines have a power and unique presence that sets them apart from Zin from anywhere else. Ultraripe fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, alcohol above 15%, amazing density and beautifully managed tannins, with some sweet grain flavors that say “old vines.”",94,39.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Paul Gregutt,2009,13.0,Old Vine,Sineann
US,"Even by past standards, this new vintage of Sineann's Old Vine Zin is spectacular, with ripe, jammy, concentrated fruit flavors of fig, black cherry and purple plum.

US,"These Pines Vineyard vines are nearing a century in age. In the new vintage, the wine seems almost brutally powerful, with rough, rugged oak flavors that will want further bottle age to mellow. Ripe blueberry and cherry tones are matched to strong streaks of caramel, cocoa and coconut. Drink 2018–25.",93,39.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Paul Gregutt,2015,13.0,Old Vine,Sineann
US,"Ripe and fruity, this forward, candied wine is for those who love ultraripe Zinfandel berry flavors, set in rich baking spices. It's full, forward and powerful, but carries a whiff of burnt rubber and some serious heat in the finish.",87,39.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Paul Gregutt,2010,13.0,Old Vine,Sineann
US,"Tight, earthy, spiced up with leaf and pepper, this old vine Zin gathers strength in the mid-palate and displays a perfect blend of sweet cherry, berry and some finishing tomato leaf. This 2007 seems a bit less ripe than previous efforts, so the fruit does not have the same sweetness, but the winemaking is exceptional and the flavors are woven beautifully. These 2007s may yet prove to be among the most ageworthy wines that Sineann has ever made.",92,36.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Paul Gregutt,2007,13.0,Old Vine,Sineann
US,"If any wine can blow away the thought that Merlot is a thin, wimpy, nondescript red, this is the wine. From the iconic Champoux Vineyard, it has magic and muscle, a broad and deep display of black fruits, coffee, licorice, dark chocolate, baking spices and beautifully built tannins. Explore and enjoy.",94,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,17.0,Champoux Vineyard,Sineann
US,"From a young block of Cab Franc at the legendary Champoux vineyard, this captures the grape's earthy, herbal elements, bringing the classic green coffee bean streaks to the tannins, and keeping the fruit tight and muscular. Cassis and purple plum flavors are wrapped in tough, chewy tannins.

Australia,"De Bortoli's 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir lacks the bright fruit and user-friendliness of its Gulf Station or Windy Peak bottlings. Maybe it's too serious for its own good?

The fruit flavors are plummy and straightforward and the easy drinkability is undeniable.",88,20.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2015,1.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"A dynamic balance between ripe, juicy fruit flavors and crisp acidity makes this medium-bodied wine both refreshing and substantive. It smells like a bowl of sliced melons, apples and grapes. After 79% Pinot Gris, the winemaker blends in Roussanne, Grüner Veltliner and a bit of Chardonnay.",90,15.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2014,18.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,Apples and pears in the aroma lead to easygoing fruit flavors and a soft broad texture in this medium-bodied fruit-forward wine. Hints of butter and vanilla sneak in on the finish.,87,15.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2015,18.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is a well-made wine at a more-than-fair price. Labeled varietally, it also holds smaller additions of other Bordeaux red grapes, most notably 6% Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, leather and cassis surround smoky oak and firm, integrated tannin, making for a complex, full-bodied and balanced experience.",91,24.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2013,4.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Tight and tannic, this majority Cab wine is distinguished by a thickness of black fruit and herbaceous back palate that gives it density, separated by bursts of vanilla and oak. Give it time to open and notes of mocha chocolate should also come through.",87,24.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"There's tremendous value in this well-made wine. It's savory in its mix of dried herb and plum notes, with smooth, softened tannins and judicious use of oak that lends richness to the palate. It'll appeal broadly.",90,23.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2013,17.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"An expressive version of the variety, this includes tiny percentages of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. Leathery plum and blueberry are the standouts in terms of aromas and flavors, with a soft, spicy streak that lifts the experience, finishing in a dusting of cocoa powder.",90,24.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2012,17.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson

US,"Nicely ripe fruit flavors and a full rounded texture give this affordably priced wine more presence than most. The aroma is honeydew melon and the flavors are ripe apple and Anjou pear, while the acidity is on the soft side.",89,13.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2015,12.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson

US,"A staple of California winemaking, this vintage is as good as ever—perfectly polished, with light aromas of toasted oak and crisp green apple, lemon-lime and tempting butter flavors, and a medium-bodied frame. The texture is silky smooth, and everything tastes harmonious and balanced.",91,17.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2015,2.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is a tasty and accessibly priced Chardonnay. It packs in lots of fruit flavor, vibrant acidity, rich texture and layers of oaky spice while showing a rare sense of seamlessness. Very Californian and compelling.",91,17.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2013,2.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson

US,"KJ's Mendocino County Zin has both red and black berry fruit flavor and the spiciness one expects from dry-farmed Mendocino County vineyards, though the tannins stick around a bit longer than one might like. Cedar definitely shows up on the finish.",87,16.0,California,Mendocino County,Virginie Boone,2009,13.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is a big, full Zinfandel that's blended with 19% Petite Sirah and 1% Chardonnay. With the right balance between fruit and spice, the wine is a liquid version of blackberry jam on toast.",87,17.0,California,Mendocino County,Virginie Boone,2010,13.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson

US,"This full-bodied wine combines spicy aromas with deep fruit flavors like plum and blackberry. The fresh, juicy texture has just enough tannin to make it appetizing. The wine has enough heft to pair well with a lot of savory and meaty dishes.",89,17.0,California,Mendocino,Jim Gordon,2013,13.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Sticky tar, dense blackberry, leather, soy and lilacs combine for a thick nose on this well-priced, widely available bottling.

This wine has commendable complexity without going over the top, and a nice, firm texture of fine tannins and good acidity for balance.",89,17.0,California,Santa Barbara,Jim Gordon,2013,6.0,Vintner's Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Concentrated and slightly dried red cherry meets with cola on the nose of this densely packed, heavy-bodied bottling. The palate shows very dried red fruit with a touch of nutmeg spice.",86,26.0,California,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,2014,1.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Root beer and slate show on the very restrained nose of this wine that combines fruit from Monterey County (66%) and Santa Barbara Counry (34%). The palate is light and slightly metallic, with iron as well as eucalyptus and shreds of cranberry and raspberry fruit.",85,26.0,California,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,2013,1.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Good winemaking lies at the heart of this wine, which also blends in smidgens of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, the grapes from a range of estate-grown sites. Balanced fruit and dusty tannins accent a generously expansive palate that is rich but not overly concentrated, shining in berry, cherry and mocha tones.",90,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2013,4.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is a well-crafted wine that's dense and delicious in juicy red fruit, black currant, licorice and nutmeg. With much of the fruit sourced from the Alexander Valley, this wine shows a managed level of ripeness and oak aging. Structured and lengthy on the finish, this is a nicely put-together package.",91,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is an impressive undertaking, made from estate vineyards across the region, all certified sustainable. Medium in build and intensity, it allows acidity to balance out the strong, interwoven tannin and power to remain buoyant in high-toned cherry and currant. It finishes with a flourish of cinnamon spice.",91,26.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2013,17.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This is a sumptuous, well-crafted wine, nearly 100% varietal and dark purple in color. It offers leathery chocolate and red cherry flavors around still-dense tannins that seem to soften in the glass. Given more than a year in oak, only a small percentage of it new, it's lively and refined.",90,26.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2012,17.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Straw yellow in color, this widely available wine offers vanilla, lemon curd, honeysuckle and a touch of browned butter on the nose. Once sipped, seared lemon and yellow apple show first, settling into a vanilla cream groove and finishing on a touch of marshmallow.",89,22.0,California,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,2014,2.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"This blend of Monterey and Santa Barbara county vineyards offers fresh aromas of lemon-lime soda, chives and a hint of smoke. The palate is framed around sour-sweet green apple, with more bitterness and tension coming from green pear flesh and citrus pith.",88,22.0,California,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,2013,2.0,Grand Reserve,Kendall-Jackson
US,"Full-bodied and forward, this offers fruit flavors of spiced cherry, along with a broad streak of vanilla. The tannins hit hard and carry a slightly charred, slightly bitter aftertaste.",87,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,1.0,Vintner's Reserve,Sweet Cheeks
US,"This is a thin, watery wine with flavors of stem rather than fruit.",82,28.0,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2012,6.0,Barrel Select,Sweet Cheeks
US,"The aromatics immediately catch your attention: an inviting mix of raspberry and tart citrus. The wine is tightly focused, with crisp edges around wild-berry flavors. Just a tiny hint of bloody beef moves it toward more Northern Rhône Syrah flavors.",87,28.0,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2013,6.0,Barrel Select,Sweet Cheeks
US,"Strongly minty with a streak of wintergreen, this barrel selection comes from the right AVA for Oregon Tempranillo, but does not fully capture the varietal flavors. It's an earthy, tart, generic red wine, with drying tannins and a short finish.",86,25.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,2011,10.0,Barrel Select,Sweet Cheeks
US,"Aged two years in French and American oak, this is a dark and meaty wine, with black fruits and a hint of blood. There's a bit of a hole in the midpalate, but streaks of cola and licorice revive the finish.",87,25.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,10.0,Barrel Select,Sweet Cheeks
France,"Firmly tannic, this wine is solid, firm and traditional in its dry structure. Black currant fruitiness shows briefly before the tannins and dark extract take over. It's a tough wine at this stage and could well remain hard. Try drinking from 2017.",85,22.0,Bordeaux,Lussac Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,2011,5.0,Cuvée Tradition,Château des Landes
France,"Dominated by 80% Merlot, this ripe and firm wine is full of red berry fruits with a solid, dry core that comes from the fruit tannins. The tannins are still young, still solid, so the wine even with its fruitiness needs to age. Drink from 2016.",87,18.0,Bordeaux,Lussac Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,2012,5.0,Cuvée Tradition,Château des Landes
France,"A big, ripe and jammy wine made from old vines. There are black plum fruits but the wine is dominated by licorice, black coffee and wood. It is powerful and very solid. Drink from 2017.",86,36.0,Bordeaux,Lussac Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,2010,17.0,Cuvée Prestige,Château des Landes
France,"Bordeaux wine should not have high alcohol; it detracts from the play between fruit and tannins, as in this wine. It is powered by its extracted structure, with flavors of bitter chocolate that leave the fruit behind.",85,36.0,Bordeaux,Lussac Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,2009,17.0,Cuvée Prestige,Château des Landes
France,"Ripe and structured, this wood-aged wine is still developing. It has a dark structure, dense blackberry fruit and powerful concentration. A peppery touch of alcohol gives it a bitter finish, which should dissipate as it ages. Drink from 2022",91,33.0,Bordeaux,Lussac Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,2015,5.0,Cuvée Prestige,Château des Landes
France,"Big and bold, this is a rich wine with firm tannins that are balanced by dense fruitiness. Spice, a dark texture and concentration hint at the extraction although this does not detract from potential of the fruit. Give this several more years before drinking, certainly don't try it before 2020.",90,33.0,Bordeaux,Lussac Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,2014,5.0,Cuvée Prestige,Château des Landes
France,"From Château des Landes' old vines, this is a concentrated, solid wine. Dark tannins have dark chocolate and licorice flavors, with a structure that dominates the fruit and needs to soften. New wood aging was perhaps excessive, but give the wine time. Drink from 2017.",88,40.0,Bordeaux,Lussac Saint-Émilion,Roger Voss,2011,5.0,Cuvée Prestige,Château des Landes
France,"Importer Bobby Kacher seemingly has a pipeline to the best rosés around Nîmes, and Mas des Bressades is a perennial favorite.

Nicely balanced spice notes mark the finish. Drink now.",91,12.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,Joe Czerwinski,2010,9.0,Cuvée Tradition,Mas des Bressades
France,"Mas des Bressades is one of the standard-bearers of Costières de Nîmes, and this rosé is a perennial favorite. Red berries and cherries lead the way, wrapped around a core of citrus acidity.

Sullivan,2013,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,J & J
US,"This 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon shows cocoa, green herb and cherry notes, with a hint of volatility. It's medium bodied on the palate, with scratchy tannins.",86,36.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Maryhill
US,"The excellent Les Collines Vineyard usually delivers more depth of flavor than this, but a cool vintage may be the culprit. Very light berry flavors, a wash of cement-like mineral and earthy tannins with an herbal edge sum up the flavor profile.",86,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Maryhill

US,This pale pink colored wine offers appealing aromas of watermelon Jolly Rancher and cherry. It drinks off dry with mouthwatering cherry flavors.,86,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2016,16.0,Rosé of,Maryhill
US,"Bone dry, earthy and leathery, this Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon seems a bit tired. The fruit is showing early signs of fading, and the tannins—earthy, green and a bit rough—may already be taking over. Some earthy, organic, almost biodynamic flavors come out in the finish.",85,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,4.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"The reserve takes the tight focus and black fruit flavors of the regular Cab and ramps them up a notch or two. Deeper, denser and darker, with flavors of cassis and licorice wrapped into the tannic, earthy depths of the finish. This has great power.",91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,4.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"This is an exceedingly light for a Cab with a reserve designation. It's also astringent, with flavors of vanilla and cut tobacco overtaking the thin fruit, and a finish that resolves in bitter coffee grounds.",85,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,4.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"As a 100% varietal wine, blue fruit, vanilla and herb aromas are followed by abundant cherry flavors, with lightly dry tannins backing them up. The oak plays a prominent role.",87,43.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"This simple Cabernet Sauvignon is lightly fruity and forward, with berry flavors that seem to fade on the midpalate. It resolves in a wash of drying, herbal tannins.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Two-thirds of this wine comes from McKinley Springs Vineyard with the rest from Kiona and Les Collines. Coffee, pencil lead, barrel spice and high-toned herb aromas lead to full-bodied coffee and cherry flavors. The tannins show some grit and grip.",87,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,4.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"An excellent Washington Malbec, this spicy delight sets up beautifully on the palate with bright, crisply defined, varietal fruit flavors of boysenberry, black cherry and cassis. Precise and penetrating, with excellent balance, it keeps the barrel flavors light and minimal.",90,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,8.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Dark, smoky and herbal, this wine, the second Malbec from Maryhill, does capture some of that grape's lovely character. Tart wild berry fruit is cut with sharp acids, and laced with herb and hints of stone. There is a bit of saddle leather showing through the tannins, but not so much as to wipe out the sweet fruit. A persistent finish tastes like fresh picked raspberries.",88,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,8.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"This is a medium-bodied Merlot, with dark fruit flavors that are cloaked in chewy, chalky, earthy and herbal tannins.",86,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,17.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"This is a pleasantly fruity wine, with tangy cherry fruit limned with some herbal, earthy tannins. Hints of tobacco and vanilla are there, but the wine quickly shows rather harsh, chalky acids that descend into a bitter, herbal finish.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,17.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"The high-toned aromas of raspberry, barrel spice and herb bring a touch of heat along with them. The palate offers tart tangy acidity, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.",87,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,16.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"The reserve seems to have spent more time in barrel, bearing a chocolatey finish, but otherwise it is quite similar to the Marryhill's regular Sangiovese. Slightly higher alcohol makes for a bit more concentration of the strawberry fruit, but the herbal, peppery bite is still there in the finish.",86,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,16.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"As is most often the case with Sangiovese, this comes across as a pleasant, rather generic red wine that could be almost anything. The fruit tastes of light cherry and plum, with a rather sour finish. Tannins are earthy and there is a hint of sweaty saddle as well.",83,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,16.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"A blend of fruit from Gunkel and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this wine offers light aromas of cherry and toasty barrel spice. The flavors are elegant, tart and juicy, with cocoa flavors lingering on the finish.",87,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,16.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill

US,"Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator.",86,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,19.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"There is very little to distinguish any of the 2010 Maryhill Cabernets from each other. This shows a dash of cassis, with a big streak of vanilla and just a hint of orange peel.",84,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,19.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Supple and inviting, this mellow take on Cabernet Franc has soft cherry-pie flavors, a dash of pepper, and a smooth, chocolaty finish, with a pleasant, toasty, caramel aftertaste.",88,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,19.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Hailing from Tudor Hills Vineyard, the aromas offer notes of padded butter, toast and spice. On the palate, the oak (70% new French) plays prominently, juxtaposed by full-bodied stone-fruit flavors that show some warmth.",88,29.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,2.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Cherries and chocolate are the hallmark of the Zins at Maryhill. The fruit is pretty and the chocolate smooth, certainly a crowd-pleasing style. The finish is clean and supple.",87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,13.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better.",84,38.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,13.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Light in color, the aromas of this wine are very varietal, with scents of cranberry, raspberry and high-toned spices. The palate is quite sweet, giving the appearance of carrying some residual sugar. It comes off as a bit hot. Still, there's enjoyment to be had.",87,44.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,13.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Toffee, exotic spice, vanilla, raspberry and cranberry aromas are backed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. There's a lot of fruit in the bottle but the oak seems to get in the way.",88,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,13.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Sweet and jammy fruit flavors suggest canned cherry and plum. That sweetness is offset by the drying, earthy tannins and flavor of dried herb.",87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,13.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"There is an unusual sensation of spritz in the mouth, though no hint of any CO2 can be seen in the glass. This is bone dry, stemmy and earthy, with the most prominent flavor.",85,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,6.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"Forward and pleasant, with a balanced attack of berry and peppery herb, this saw 20 months in one-fifth new French oak. The resulting toasty, lightly-chocolaty finish is pleasing, though it tends to override the subtle fruit. Drink soon.",86,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,6.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"This wine, which is 100% varietal, is a blend of fruit from Art Den Hoed and Gunkel vineyards. Aromas of cranberry, clove and fresh flowers are followed by coffee and floral flavors that show elegance and persistence.",88,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,26.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"No information on blending was provided by the winery; this does not show typical character of truly varietal Grenache. Rather, it falls into the category of mutt wine; a ready-to-drink, nondescript red with a stiff, herbal, earthy finish.",83,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,26.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill
US,"This Proprietor's Reserve Grenache is one of a handful of Maryhill's 2010 reds that improves upon the previous vintage. Sappy and relatively substantial, this has a core of Bing cherry, along with chewy tannins and an earthy finish.",86,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,26.0,Proprietor's Reserve,Maryhill

US,"This vineyard high up toward the Blue Mountains is best known for its Syrah. Aromas of garden herbs and cranberry lead to a tart, lightly grippy palate. It needs time to stretch its legs but the balance is there.",89,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Burnt Bridge

Sullivan,2012,4.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Burnt Bridge
US,"This captures the spicy vitality of Les Collines Merlot, with pretty cherry and plum fruit set against a smattering of new oak toast. It's a clean, well-defined wine that continues into a tasty finish with highlights of roasted walnuts and clove.",90,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,17.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Burnt Bridge
US,"This is a knife-sharp Viognier, offering precise, chiseled flavors of citrus rind, Meyer lemon and grapefruit. The piercing acidity belies a wine whose flavors are fully ripe, and deliver an extended, mineral-drenched finish.",91,25.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,25.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Burnt Bridge
US,"Hailing from one of the state's premier Syrah sites, this wine leads with aromas of berry, coffee, chicory and violets. The flavors are supple, backed by lightly grainy tannins.",89,35.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Burnt Bridge
US,"Lovely aromatics introduce this single vineyard Syrah with a snootfull of raspberry, pomegranate, cherry and rock. There's an elusive whiff of diesel also, lifting the palate of this very young, very compact wine. This could easily go 8–10 years in the cellar.",93,34.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Burnt Bridge
US,"Despite the abv listed, this wine does not seem especially ripe. Peppery highlights carry a whiff of onion, and between the alcohol burn and the green edges, the wine has not come together. Aging in 40% new oak adds some toast, but not grip or density.",86,36.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Kontos
US,"Aromas of vanilla and baking spices take the lead, followed by dark fruit. The palate is all about texture, showing a creamy richness to the fruit and barrel flavors that linger. The oak plays a prominent role but it generally works.",91,38.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Kontos
US,"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine starts out aromatically reserved before blossoming to reveal notes of dark raspberry, dried cranberry, woodspice, vanilla and anise. It shows the warmth of the vintage with concentrated, black-fruit flavors backed by a light squeeze of tannins followed by a lengthy finish. The oak plays prominently but it works.",91,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Kontos
US,"The aromas are fresh, with notes of cranberry, red currant, baking spice and Red Vines. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, trailing a bit on the finish. The vineyard, one of the state's top Syrah sites, doesn't seem to stand out as much as it typically does.",88,41.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Kontos
US,"All varietal and aged in neutral French oak, this wine offers brooding aromas of coffee, cream and violets. The herb and savory flavors are soft and reserved in feel with a lingering finish.",89,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Savage Grace
US,"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity. A uniquely styled wine without an easy comparison in the region.",91,26.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,2.0,Celilo Vineyard,Savage Grace
US,"Aged in equal parts new and neutral French oak along with stainless steel—the latter with no malolactic fermentation—this wine brings out notes of toast, straw and citrus. It has a thick mouth-feel while alternately delivering good concentration and length. It has a thick somewhat ponderous, lemony feel while alternately delivering good concentration and length. It doesn't quite feel entirely like Chardonnay but it's quite delicious.",88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,2.0,Celilo Vineyard,Savage Grace
US,"Aromatically brooding, this suggests dry chocolate, violets, brown stems, herbs, black pepper and smoked meat. It's restrained in style with pure, tart blue fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins that need additional time in bottle to settle in fully. Enjoy it at the dinner table to see it at its best.",91,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Kerloo
US,"A bright, vivacious, juicy and fruit-driven style, loaded with boysenberries. Tart and racy, this has just a hint of a gamy undertone. The finish has smooth, silky tannins, and plenty of staying power.",90,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,6.0,Les Collines Vineyard,Kerloo
US,"The winery's first release of this variety offers aromas of apple, chamomile, spice and lees. On the palate, the green-apple acids are tart and bracing, needing some food to tame them.",89,48.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2015,2.0,Celilo Vineyard,Kerloo
US,"The aromas of gooseberry, lime, herb and passion fruit pop. The flavors are broad and tart. The concentration isn't quite all there but it brings plenty to hold the interest and should do well at the dinner table.",88,22.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2015,12.0,Boushey Vineyard,Kerloo
US,"Aged in neutral French oak, this wine opens with appealing aromas of black pepper, dried herbs and citrus peel.

Sullivan,2014,44.0,Boushey Vineyard,Kerloo
France,"The citrus notes on the nose are subdued. On the palate, they strike up and portray tangerine and lemon on the slender, dry and fresh body. The finish almost has a tropical quality.",89,13.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2016,7.0,Signature,Domaine Robert Klingenfus
France,"Showing fine acidity, this has a creamy texture and a rich, rounded feel. Full of pear and creamed-apple flavors, it has some weight and a full-bodied character without losing the crisp acidity.",87,15.0,Alsace,Alsace,Roger Voss,2011,7.0,Signature,Domaine Robert Klingenfus
France,"Light in color, this is a fruity, softly tannic and lightweight wine. It brings out red fruits that are now maturing, giving spice and a touch of pepper with final acidity. Drink now.",85,17.0,Alsace,Alsace,Roger Voss,2010,1.0,Signature,Domaine Robert Klingenfus
France,"Jasmine and summer blossom hover over ripe, aromatic aspects suggesting melon or quince that shine with power on the dry, streamlined and taut palate. The freshness is immense in this precise, bracing and charming wine.",91,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,7.0,Signature,René Muré
France,"Very pure notes of cherry and strawberry pervade this wine. They are perfumed with a slight conifer scent that spells freshness and lifted ease. The palate has an unforced, elegant concentration. This is charming and fresh, with convincing depth, purity and a lasting, fresh finish.",90,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2014,1.0,Signature,René Muré
France,"The nose is shy and does not give much away. On the palate, beautifully pure red currant and tart red-cherry notes come through. The slender body is pervaded by freshness and has lovely overtones of conifer and oak leaf. It is later on that the fine but firm structure comes to bear. This is light but has depth and the potential to develop.",90,25.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,1.0,Signature,René Muré
France,"Ripe, yellow pear, stone and earth are united by a zesty grapefruit perfume. The streak of purity at the center of this is invigorating, with an enlivening backbone of tinkling acidity. This bottling does justice to a difficult vintage—and is all the more alluring for it. Something racy and pure at the core makes you want to delve deeply into this wine.",92,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2014,18.0,Signature,René Muré
France,"A restrained nose with hints of hazelnut, banana and peach leads to a juicy but restrained palate where texture is as important as flavor. This wine is balanced and structured. A slight touch of residual sugar rounds out the fruit and creates a just off-dry finish.",90,22.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2015,23.0,Signature,René Muré
France,"This is a medium-dry wine that has more spice than sweetness. It is warm and full in the mouth, and accented with a touch of pepper, brisk acidity and lychee flavors. The wine is rich and ready to drink. Screwcap.",87,23.0,Alsace,Alsace,Roger Voss,2011,23.0,Signature,René Muré
France,"Earth and roses, lemon zest and orange flesh: these are the contrasts of this refreshing, toned but textured Gewurztraminer that shows the full weight of its rose perfume on the palate. Its dryness underlines earth rather than fruit, but has no less charm for that. On the contrary: the lingering aftertaste leaves a lasting impression.",92,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,Anne Krebiehl MW,2014,23.0,Signature,René Muré
US,"The historic Pritchard Hill producer swings for the fences with this Cab, intense in black cherry, blackberry and cedar. Hard to penetrate on first try, it demands cellaring to soften its wall of hearty tannins, the merest hint of chocolate-coffee begging to break out. Lushly powerful and complex, it can be enjoyed through 2027.",91,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Signature,Chappellet
US,"This lovely wine offers classic elements of cedar and tar built around a medium-bodied weight of soft, complex texture. Smoky oak never detracts from the layering of black licorice and blackberry that builds as it goes, this wine defined most by its substantial length.",93,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,4.0,Signature,Chappellet
US,"Owner Molly Chappellet's beloved baby, this white is deliciously crisp, dry and balanced, with layers of Meyer lemon, waxy apple and floral gardenia. Percolating acidity maintains its freshness beneath its rich texture and tropical succulence.",92,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2016,30.0,Signature,Chappellet
US,"From the family that has made the variety from a three-acre block on Pritchard Hill since the 1960s, missing a few years to replant, this is such a lovely, well-composed and deliciously enjoyable wine it might induce tears of happiness, that's how good it is. Apricot, vanilla and cream surround a rounded, smooth lushness spiked in spicy nutmeg and tea.",94,32.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,30.0,Signature,Chappellet

US,"Cofermented with 2% Viognier, this elegant Syrah rests on a base of toast, coffee grounds, loam and savory herbs. The fruit—pie cherries and plums—is subservient to the details of earth, mushroom and leather. All is beautifully integrated, balanced and long. A wine to savor.",93,40.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,6.0,Signature,Doyenne
US,"A blend of fruit from near equal parts Ciel du Cheval, Grand Ciel and Boushey vineyards, this wine is aromatically brooding at present with notes of coffee, mineral, boysenberry and clove. The palate is more generous, with fruit and barrel flavors that walk hand in hand through the finish.",89,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,6.0,Signature,Doyenne
US,"This opens with deep, dense dark-fruit goodness. It's a massive wine that bursts with blackberry, black cherry and cassis. After that opening explosion of ripe fruit, it seems to float through the mouth, like riding in a big-finned Cadillac from the 1950s. Consume this one within 2–5 years.",92,40.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2009,6.0,Signature,Doyenne
France,"From old vines, this now-mature wine shows almonds, touches of toast and gentle acidity. It has a creamy texture that only hints at the original minerality and crispness. Now, it is a smooth wine with only a light connection to the Melon grape, offering concentration and a rich aftertaste. Drink now.",89,19.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu,Roger Voss,2009,33.0,Signature,Domaine du Haut Bourg
France,"This is an immediately attractive and fruity wine. Bright acidity is rounded out by warm peach and pear flavors, with a mineral texture that will allow the wine to age. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be at its best from 2016.",90,15.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu,Roger Voss,2013,33.0,Sur Lie,Domaine du Haut Bourg
France,"This is a soft and easy wine. It has light apple and lemon flavors along with a orange zest tang. It is a light, crisp wine that is totally ready to drink.",87,14.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu,Roger Voss,2015,33.0,Sur Lie,Domaine du Haut Bourg
France,"This soft wine is gentle, rounded and immediately accessible. Its lightly crisp acidity shows in the lemon fruitiness and in a zingy texture. The wine is ready to drink.",87,15.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu,Roger Voss,2016,33.0,Sur Lie,Domaine du Haut Bourg
France,"Light and fresh, this is an apple-crisp wine with delicious acidity and a refreshing lemon tang. A finely textured character gives shape to the wine and supports the crunchy fruit. Drink this wine now.",87,15.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu,Roger Voss,2014,33.0,Sur Lie,Domaine du Haut Bourg
US,"Intense, spicy and loaded with grapefruit, pineapple and citrus, this has a unique intensity and power. If you distill Washington Riesling down to its essential fruit/sugar/acid components, this expresses it beautifully. At just 9.8% alcohol, it's a definite Kabinett style, with so much acid that the 2% sugar does not signify.",91,22.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2007,7.0,Champoux Vineyard,O•S Winery
US,"Stiff and tart, this young wine needs a few more years of cellaring to fill itself out. The balance is right, and the vineyard's full-bodied tannins are there in abundance.",88,28.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2009,19.0,Champoux Vineyard,O•S Winery
US,"This is an especially fine version of this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc; sadly, it may be awhile before we see it again as the vineyard suffered severe damage in 2011. Loaded with pure, rich cherry fruit, it adds layers of graphite, cedar and coffee over a mineral base.",91,28.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2010,19.0,Champoux Vineyard,O•S Winery
US,"This inexpensive red wine has muscle and depth. It's chocolaty, rich and loaded with ripe, supple fruits and smooth caramel. There is plenty of coffee flavor, a sweet and broad mid-palate, and a simple but satisfying finish.",89,20.0,Washington,Washington,Paul Gregutt,2006,3.0,Red Wine,O•S Winery
US,"This wine is 100% varietal coming from one of the top vineyards in the state. Reserved aromas of spice box, blackberry, barrel tones and gun smoke lead to elegantly styled fruit flavors. There are some interesting thing going on but they don't all come together at present.",88,65.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Champoux Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"The oak (83% new French and American) seems a bit overweighted for the fruit that's in the bottle on this 100% varietal wine. The notes of vanilla, cocoa and woodspice get out in front of herb and cherry flavors that seem slightly stewed.",89,65.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2010,4.0,Champoux Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"Champoux is one of Washington's most revered vineyards, known especially for the rich, black cherry fruit on display here. However, this wine seems to be aging rather quickly, the flavors turning soft and leafy in the midpalate, and the wine's rim hinting at the beginning tones of brick. It's drinking nicely, and should be consumed near term for best enjoyment.",88,50.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Paul Gregutt,2007,17.0,Champoux Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"100% varietal from one of Washington's most esteemed vineyards, it's tightly wound and slow to reveal its charms.

Sullivan,2010,17.0,Champoux Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"This wine is all varietal, coming from one of the state's top sites. Despite the warm vintage and site, it opens with aromas of herbs along with barrel spice and tightly wound dark fruit. The black fruit flavors are fresh and lively, showing elegance and persistence with a tight core of fine grained tannins.",92,65.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,4.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"Coming from one of the state's premier vineyards, barrel-spice aromas are at the fore on first pour, with black-fruit and herb notes far in the background. The dark-fruit flavors are concentrated initially, tapering slightly toward the finish.",89,65.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,4.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"From a vineyard sited near the winery, this is the most supple, balanced and evenly detailed of the 2007 red wines from Fidélitas. The lightly muscled, compact fruit flavors bring black cherry, cassis, and plum together, with a strong minerality providing subtext. A suggestion of smoke suffuses the finish.",91,55.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2007,4.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"Barrel aromas are out front on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and baking spice followed by dark plum. The flavors are dense, dark and palate coating. The wood shows quite prominently on the palate as well but if you can get beyond it, there are good things happening.",89,50.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,17.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"This single-vineyard selection is 100% varietal, with deep cassis, dark chocolate and espresso flavors. The alcohol comes out as a slight burn, but the tannins have been nicely rounded off and this will drink well immediately.",89,50.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2011,19.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Fidelitas
US,"This is a blend of Merlot (42%), Cabernet Franc (32%) and Cabernet Sauvignon coming from vines with an average age of 30 years. It has light but complex notes of cherries, plum, herbs, flowers and bittersweet chocolate. It's restrained and understated in style with seamless fruit flavors, mouthwatering acids and edgy tannins that need some time in the cellar to calm down.",93,60.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2010,3.0,Champoux Vineyard,Andrew Will
US,"Merlot (44%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Cabernet Franc (29%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%), with the balance of blend of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Alluring aromas of black plum, earth, flowers and green herb are followed by generous, palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. It brings a sense of texture that captivates.",92,74.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,5.0,Champoux Vineyard,Andrew Will
US,"The most immediately accessible of Will's three Horse Heaven Hills wines, it brings notes of scorched earth, herbs, incense, toast and abundant dark fruit.

US,"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",86,25.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2005,16.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Andrew Will
US,"Among all the latest 2009 releases from Andrew Will, the Ciel du Cheval is the most shuttered and in need of further bottle age. Tight and tannic, it is unusually herbal for this hot climate site. Even after many hours of breathing time, it remains stubbornly closed. Given the vineyard history and winery credentials, it seems highly likely to improve significantly with more time.",88,55.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2009,5.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Andrew Will
US,"Winemaker Chris Camarda is antiformulaic; his wines in 2008 feature radically different blends from the 2007s. This is a third each Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cab Franc. It reflects the vineyard's penchant for tart berry fruit set atop astringent, mineral-driven tannins. It's tight and dense, with vertical power. Flavors roll gracefully into a medium-length finish.",93,55.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2008,5.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Andrew Will
US,"A blend of Merlot (56%) and Cabernet Franc, this wine opens with aromas of flowers, huckleberry, cardamom and green herbs, along with light barrel accents. The flavors are dense and rich but far from over the top, supported by chewy tannins and a fruit-filled finish that sails into the distance. Best after 2020.",92,64.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Sean P. Sullivan,2013,5.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Andrew Will

US,"Slightly shy aromas of blackberry, black plum and turned black soil are simple and straightforward on this wine.

A sip enlivens the mouth and wipes clean on the finish.",90,60.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2013,1.0,Barrel Select,Foley
US,"Caper berry, turned earth, blistered cherry tomato and puttanesca sauce aromas lead the nose on this top-end Pinot from Bill Foley's eponymous winery. It's wildly flavorful on the palate, offering perfectly ripe red fruit alongside woody herbs of oregano, thyme and rosemary, then leading into darkly elegant elements of black licorice, cardamom and chai spices.",92,60.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2012,1.0,Barrel Select,Foley

Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2015,2.0,Barrel Select,Foley
US,"Subtlety paints an emergent nose of lemon zest and honeysuckle, given richness with dollops of cream.

US,"Richard Sanford and winemaker Nick de Luca are making wines to stand the test of time, including this bottling that offers dried roses, rust and light cranberry on the nose.

Rita Hills,Matt Kettmann,2012,1.0,La Encantada Vineyard,Alma Rosa
US,"Richard and Thekla Sanford of Alma Rosa produce much lighter styles of Pinot Noir than many of their neighbors. In this bottling, that translates to bright pomegranate and cranberry fruit with hints of anise and rose on the nose.

US,"Though an accidental opening in a blind tasting, this wine was stellar a decade old, easily rising above its current counterparts. Extremely complex and savory aromas of au jus sauce, porcini mushrooms, charred beef, black olive, mulberry and hearty black plum give way to a mushroom-laden palate.

This is an excellent value Cabernet.",90,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Barrel Select,Bodega Norton

This feels syrupy and rich, almost sticky, with grabby oak and blackened flavors of berry fruits that ultimately register as nondescript. A peppery, hot finish is plump but low on detail.",86,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,4.0,Barrel Select,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"An oaky specimen that starts with maple syrup aromas, but it soon finds darker aromas of coffee, lemony oak and leather.

Argentina,"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors.

Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.",86,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,17.0,Barrel Select,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"The nose is full of dust, cotton candy, peach pit and banana, while the palate is sugary and tastes like honeydew melon and pear. Fleshy and bland on the finish.",83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,2.0,Barrel Select,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Solid, compact and full-bodied, with blackberry, licorice and warm asphalt on the nose. The structure is quite good and tight, while the flavors of blackberry and cassis are sweetened and softened by mocha and creamed coffee flavors. Powerful but under control, and not too complicated.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,4.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"This dark-looking Cabernet smells chunky, raisiny and earthy. In the mouth, it's dense and extracted but blocky and heavy. Roasted oaky blackberry flavors finish with tannic residue and an oak-based flavor of clove.",86,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Norton Reserva is one of Argentina's best Cabernetss for the money. This vintage offers a mineral aroma along with rose petal, baked plum and spiced cherry scents. It feels deep, generous and balanced, with cassis, blackberry, earth and molasses flavors.",90,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Grapey and foxy, with green, minty aromas and a hollow center. The palate is bulky, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are strained and grapey. Sweet and incomplete; grapey but not in harmony.",83,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,4.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"This screaming violet-colored chunkster is big and blocky up front, with aromas of vitamins and grapy black fruits. A giant palate holds big tannins, while heady flavors of black plum and oak spice finish minty, toasty and with power.",88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Raisiny black-fruit aromas are jammy and a clarion indicator of what's to come. In the mouth, this Malbec is saturated and chunky, with extreme ripeness. Flavors of raisin, prune and baked berry fruits come with secondary spice and pepper notes. The finish is earthy, heavy and rich but short on vibrancy.",88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Opaque purple and thick in the glass, this wine has inky, supercharged aromas of ripe blackberry and spice. It feels amped up but balanced, with more intensity and clarity than what most other $18 reds offer. The flavors of wild berry, mild herb and chocolate finish in a rich, toasty wrapping.",92,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Pointed, sharp aromas leave an angular bouquet. The rest of the wine is jumpy, furry and a bit funky, with pointed plum and raspberry flavors and then a toasty, oaky finish with bitterness, heat and leftover butter flavors.",84,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,17.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Applesauce and fruit salad are rather strange, unconvincing aromas for Merlot, and the palate of plum and wild berry is big, broad and lunky. Jammy on the back end, with herbal berry flavors on the finish. Acceptable red wine but nothing special.",83,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,17.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Waxy apple aromas are chunky, dusty and a bit choppy. Ditto the palate, which is thick and on the full side, with moderate acidity. Apple, savory oak and spice flavors finish with a briny, saline note.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,2.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"A little funky and jumpy at first, but it settles down. Rapsberry, pepper and a hint of green herb give it a snappy outlook, and while it's mostly solid, it may be a tiny bit stretched compared to others. In between the folds, there's mocha, pepper and a reedy bite. Nice wine with a couple of minor flaws.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2005,6.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
Argentina,"Deep purple in color, with an inky nose that brings licorice and jammy black fruit aromas. This is a lush, soft-bodied style of Syrah with a meaty mouthfeel and candied, jammy flavors of blackberry and stewed black cherry. Finishes sweet and chocolaty; could use a bit more structure and spine.",86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,6.0,Reserva,Bodega Norton
US,"Muted in somewhat floral sensibilities, this wine features a low dose of oak behind its blend of Merlot, Syrah, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Despite the preponderance of grapes, it somehow lacks fruit and manages to hit but one note, making for a soft, approachable and straightforward wine.",84,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2011,3.0,Barrel Select,Rutherford Hill
US,"Sanguine, this Merlot-dominant blend is juicy with well-toned structure and length. Smaller percentages of Syrah and Malbec provide succulence and softness, while also offering a density of black cherry and berry, finished in dark chocolate.",88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,3.0,Barrel Select,Rutherford Hill
US,"This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice.",90,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,5.0,Barrel Select,Rutherford Hill
US,"Driven by 72% Merlot, with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Cabernet Franc, this affordable offering is brawny and tightly wound in woody tannin, with a thickness to the texture. Big oak cradles bold flavors of black coffee and tobacco.",88,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,5.0,Barrel Select,Rutherford Hill
US,"Structured and grippy, this small-production wine offers the appellation's dusty tannins around coconut, vanilla, plum and dark cherry. Medium in body and length, it shows the ripeness and instant likability of the vintage.",87,60.0,California,Rutherford,Virginie Boone,2012,4.0,Limited Release,Rutherford Hill
US,Sour apple and fennel characterize this wine upon entry. These follow through on the nose and palate around a concentrated core of golden honey and lemony acidity.,88,28.0,California,Carneros-Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Limited Release,Rutherford Hill
US,"Blended with 18% Merlot, this shows a mix of black cherry, fig and sweet prune fruit flavors. Some smoke from barrel aging comes in, and it's good right up to the finish, which has a gluey undertone.",86,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,19.0,Barrel Select,Vin du Lac
US,"There is no varietal specificity to be found in this 100% Cabernet Franc. A wine labeled Barrel Select brings certain expectations, which this fails to meet. It's thin and herbal, with stemmy tannins and only a bare suggestion of black cherry fruit.",83,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,19.0,Barrel Select,Vin du Lac
US,"Pleasing toasty notes greet your first sniff, followed by apple pie fruit flavors with hints of plum and banana. It's a light, creamy, easy-drinking confection.",87,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2012,2.0,Barrel Select,Vin du Lac

US,"Blackberry fruit is the focus of this one-dimensional Syrah. Some coffee flavors come into play, presumably from barrel aging, and the tannins are rough and grainy.",85,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,6.0,Barrel Select,Vin du Lac
US,"This lovely, golden-colored wine comes from the Dutton family's Mill Station Vineyard in the heart of Green Valley, a cool, structured appellation within the larger confines of the Russian River Valley. Heady caramel and vanilla highlights wrap around a balance of acidity and bright spots of lemon and quince. The minerality of the wine balances its intensity in expert ways.",93,75.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Barrel Select,B Cellars
US,"Rich honeyed apple and crème brûlée rise on the nose of this classically styled wine, tight in texture and weight with a boldness of baked pineapple and nutmeg. Lengthy and complex, it draws much of the fruit from Dutton's Mill Station Vineyard in Green Valley, an appellation that can deliver lots of spice and minerality; both are on display here.",92,47.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Dutton Ranch,B Cellars
US,"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in half new French oak, this brawny Syrah hails from a vineyard known for its mix of power and finesse. Sanguine and smoky, the fruit leans toward blueberry and the texture to leather, a streak of graphite in the background. Tannins are firm and sizable, with a balanced finish.",92,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Virginie Boone,2011,6.0,Stagecoach Vineyard,B Cellars
US,"This is a substantial wine, concentrated in dark red berry color and flavor, from cherry to wild strawberry to more savory rhubarb compote. Muted on the nose, it has an underlying woody, herbal character that balances the vibrancy of the fruit.",86,22.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Rosé of,MacPhail
US,"Many vineyards were sourced for this dry rosé, made from a selection of Pinot Noir clones. Beautifully pale rose petal color, its aromas and flavors lean herbal before fresh notes of raspberry and strawberry set in. The finish is intense.",87,22.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Rosé of,MacPhail
US,"This is a robustly reduced, tightly wound and still quite youthful wine, showing both the vintage and the appellation in warmer years, with an intensity of black tea, tar and black cherry. Full bodied, it's powerfully weighted and structured.",89,49.0,California,Green Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Dutton Ranch,MacPhail
US,"It's like Christmas in a glass the way the aromas on this wine settle keenly on pine and sugar plum. Earthy with a touch of dried herb, the wine's mouthfeel is velvety with a kick, the body full-figured in blackberry intensity, with the whole wrapped in substantial oak. The weight and firmness suggest cellaring, through 2017.",88,49.0,California,Green Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,1.0,Dutton Ranch,MacPhail
US,"Punchy, sizable tannins make this wine a beast at first. It's dry on the palate, yet sultry, well-defined layers of dark cherry and toasty vanilla-oak manage to persist around seasonings of minty dried herb and cinnamon. From a well-known vineyard high atop what is called the Petaluma Gap, it's characteristically robust and age-worthy, able to cellar through 2022.",90,49.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2012,1.0,Gap's Crown Vineyard,MacPhail
US,"Steely and intense in baked pear and pineapple, this white from a well-known vineyard more often associated with Pinot Noir offers contrast in a quality package. On the one hand, it's bright and vibrant, and on the other, there's a richness of caramel and oak, the wine coming in like a lion, out like a lamb. Cellaring might equalize the sides; hold through 2020.",90,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2012,2.0,Gap's Crown Vineyard,MacPhail
US,"This wine initially presents itself as lighter in body than it actually is, a tease from the cool-climate aromas of cucumber, dill and cranberry tea. The oak is toasty with a whiff of smoke, the acidity somewhat subdued. An appealing funk of earth gives it varietal distinction.",89,49.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,MacPhail
US,"This is just a gorgeous wine, so easy to enjoy, juicy in watermelon, grapefruit and dark, baked strawberry tart, a taste of summer evoked from every sip. Textured and complex, it gives a squeeze of blood orange that lingers and remains fresh through the finish. It's from the owner's estate vineyard, sought after by many other producers and made by Siduri's Adam Lee.",91,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Rosé of,Bucher
US,"Wild in barely ripe strawberry, grapefruit and a hint of mint, it hails from great ground, the Bucher Vineyard along Russian River Valley's Westside Road. A tinge of orange blossom and orange playfully intermingle on the nose and on the palate. Midweight and layered, it's a lovely wine.",90,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Rosé of,Bucher
US,"Austere and elegant, this wine opens in the glass to deliver fresh-cut apple, matchstick and graham cracker, balancing fruit-forwardness with complexity. From an estate property with only two acres planted to the variety, the rest to Pinot Noir, it exudes its Middle Reach roots, ripe and fresh, and entirely aged in stainless steel.",90,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Unoaked,Bucher
US,"This wine was aged five months entirely in stainless steel and yet it presents a medium-bodied, velvety texture and lushness of tropical fruit and vanilla bean.

Darker hued than many of its counterparts, it retains a tannic grip to the finish.",86,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Rosé of,Bruliam
US,"This was made from a saignée after a full-day's skin contact, resulting in a sultry, soulful, tiny-production wine that's refreshing and fruity in orange and lime, dry and completely in balance.",90,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2015,1.0,Rosé of,Bruliam
US,"Smooth and juicy in red fruit with an edge of more savory cranberry, this wine from a great vineyard source rises to its occasion and to its site, offering high acidity, medium weight and a lingering, nearly spicy finish. It's enjoyable now but should show well through 2018.",91,55.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Gap's Crown Vineyard,Bruliam
US,"Tightly coiled in fruit and oak, this is a young yet vibrantly lush, plush and juicy wine.It's ready to expand on the palate as it opens to reveal exotic baking spice, textured velvety softness and swathes of black cherry and pomegranate. Medium bodied and exuberant, it'll drink well with food.",92,56.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Gap's Crown Vineyard,Bruliam
US,"Soft and earthy, this wine's herbal, funky nature suggests Carneros as much as Sonoma Coast, with black tea and crunchy dried cranberry lurking on the back of the palate. Medium in weight, it eases into a mellow finish.",88,46.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2013,1.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Bruliam
US,"Earthy and just the slightest touch reduced, this is a feral, juicy and intriguing wine from the well-known site, complex and medium to almost light-bodied in texture and approach. Cherry and pomegranate compote meet cardamom baking spices to suggest warmth and comfort in a glass.",93,46.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2014,1.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Bruliam
US,"Hearty sagebrush, rust and dust meet with dried Montgomery cherry and tart pomegranate aromas on the nose of this bottling from a Healdsburg-based producer.

It's fresh and penetrating.",90,13.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2015,1.0,Rosé of,Acrobat

US,"To tame Durell is no easy feat—indeed at first this wine exudes matchstick and robustness on the nose and palate. But tameness comes in the form of lemon and grapefruit pith, brightening the load, with a sinewy structure supporting its core. The finish is succulent in honey and stone. Drink now through 2020.",96,55.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Durell Vineyard,Gary Farrell

US,"Made from one of the vineyard's historic blocks, this is a lush, inviting and complex wine, defined by golden honey apple and nutmeg.

A tang of white pepper flirts on the finish.",95,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Bacigalupi Vineyard,Gary Farrell
US,"From the historic family-owned vineyard down a ways on Westside Road, this Bacigalupi wine is richer and more layered than some of the producer's other vineyard-designates, providing a meatier, more tropical edge of fleshy butter and nuttiness. The aromatics balance things out, sharing whispers of orange blossom and caramel.",90,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2013,2.0,Bacigalupi Vineyard,Gary Farrell

US,"At first this profoundly compelling wine seems rather light, but as it pirouettes on a base of cherry and sassafras, it constantly shifts and sends up shafts of previously undetected flavors. Popcorn, saffron and just the faintest hint of barnyard emerge—suddenly it becomes a full-throttle cherry bomb that can best be described as yummy.",94,48.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,1.0,Freedom Hill Vineyard,Elizabeth Chambers
US,"This is a delicious expression of the genre, medium bodied and forcefully crisp, with delicate lacings of cherry, apricot and peach.

It offers refreshing acidity alongside a meaty body and wet-stone minerality.",90,28.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Virginie Boone,2016,26.0,Rosé of,Anaba
US,"A bite of spicy wild strawberry marks this wine in flavor and aroma, complementing the soft, lush layers that follow. A candied, marshmallow-like quality gives the wine a sense of ripeness that is probably more pronounced aromatically than otherwise. The sense of sweetness is offset by balanced acidity and a lengthy, spicy finish.",88,46.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,1.0,Dutton Ranch,Anaba
US,"Sublime and gritty in stony, gravelly texture, this wine surprises and awes in its commingling of salty lime, focused acidity and complex tones of apple, pear and fig. Medium-bodied, it unravels slowly in the glass, continuing to pursue different avenues of flavor and intellectual pleasure.",95,42.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Dutton Ranch,Anaba
US,"This is a savory, almost briny, cool-climate white that's unusual for the appellation in some ways—it's crisp and bright in Meyer lemon and jasmine. Still, for all its elegance, it offers just as much in the way of creamy texture amid a midpalate of fresh-cut apple, peaking in a lightly buttered note on the finale.",92,36.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,2.0,Dutton Ranch,Anaba

US,"Here's a great Syrah from a vineyard not specifically known for this grape. It immediately impacts the palate with concentrated flavors of raspberry and cassis swathed in coffee liqueur, dark chocolate and a hint of red licorice. This has great concentration and length; drink it over the next 6–8 years.",94,28.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2009,6.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Tamarack Cellars

US,"There's an oaky, campfire-like personality to this white, a touch of matchstick on the nose that burns off over time. From there, it's a fuller style wine offering creaminess on the palate and a persistence of baked fruit, from apple to pear.",87,44.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,2012,2.0,Dutton Ranch,MacRostie
US,"This is a hearty wine from a famous place, farmed by esteemed, long-time growers. Apple and pear skin show up first, with a baked quality to the fruit that never gets jammy.

US,"This bottling from the Kathryn Hall family of wines is rich and juicy but not sweet at all. The nose begins with sage, clove, black cherry, concentrated violets and rose petals, with a turned-loam quality. The palate shows beets, fennel, sagebrush, dark red cherry and plum. A eucalyptus and menthol quality rises on the finish.",93,75.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matt Kettmann,2013,1.0,Sierra Mar Vineyard,Walt
US,"This vineyard-designate opens in inviting, perfumed aromatics of apple blossom and honeysuckle. On the palate it reveals substantial depth and breadth, the oak characteristic quite caramelized. Meaty in lemon zest and meringue, it provides a weight of body that's nicely balanced against stony minerality and traces of nutmeg.",93,55.0,California,Sonoma County,Virginie Boone,2014,2.0,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Walt
Argentina,"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.",85,15.0,Other,Neuquén,Michael Schachner,2007,1.0,Reserva,Chaltén
Argentina,"A lean and clean specimen with basic but familiar raspberry and cherry aromas. The palate is a little thin and acidic, but with that comes freshness. Flavors of cherry and mixed herbs are good but sharp, while a light dusting of pepper covers the lean, snappy finish.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,1.0,Reserva,Chaltén
Argentina,"This is a clean, basic wine with white-fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is well balanced, and there's a good level of citrus flavor along with green herb accents. On the finish, it's more tropical, with a hint of banana.",85,14.0,Other,Neuquén,Michael Schachner,2012,12.0,Reserva,Chaltén
Argentina,"Plenty of charcoal, toast and resin work the bouquet, while the fruit seems a little candied. There's a mix of black berry notes and oak, which results in a creamy mouthfeel and lingering vanilla and sweetness. A complete Malbec, but one that's neither unique nor overly special.",87,19.0,Other,Neuquén,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Gran Reserva,Chaltén
Argentina,"This is one of the top Malbecs from Neuquén and it's under $20. The bouquet is focused, dark and loaded with inky berry aromas and graphite. The palate is deep and layered, and full bodied, with blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors. A long, spicy, toasty finish is warming but not hot. Drink through 2017.",92,19.0,Other,Neuquén,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Gran Reserva,Chaltén
Argentina,"Hard cherry and spice aromas are varietally correct, while the palate is standard in feel, with toasty, creamy flavors of sweet berry. Has enough acidity and vibrancy to rank as juicy on the finish.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,1.0,Reserva,Nieto Senetiner
Argentina,"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy. Quite tangy on the finish, and overall it achieves only a certain level of weight and prominence. No oak.",83,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,1.0,Reserva,Nieto Senetiner
Argentina,"Charred and smells of coffee, toasted oak, minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic, with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest. Exhibits mostly faux oak and window dressing, but for $11 it isn't bad.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,4.0,Reserva,Nieto Senetiner
Argentina,"Blowsy and tropical, with aromatic flabbiness. The feel is acceptable and the flavors of papaya and dry white fruits bring some saucy, resiny qualities. Finishes with sappy, resiny oak notes and just enough Chardonnay character to not be disastrous.",83,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,2.0,Reserva,Nieto Senetiner
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for some oily rusticity. The palate is full with okay acidity and sweet flavors suggestive of mango, pineapple and melon.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,37.0,Reserva,Nieto Senetiner
Argentina,"Dry and smoky on one hand, but also somewhat damp and soupy on the nose. This is a medium-to-full PN with a dark color and a mix of sweet and dry flavors as well as chunky oak and chocolate on the back palate. Creamy, sweet and showing a lot of barrel influence.",85,21.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,Michael Schachner,2008,1.0,Reserva,Luigi Bosca
Argentina,"An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents. Solid, a bit tannic and slightly resiny from barrel aging; but it's also a legitimate Pinot Noir with some elevated qualities.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,Michael Schachner,2006,1.0,Reserva,Luigi Bosca
Argentina,"Earthy and seemingly on the edge of being overripe, this is a wine that deals dark-fruit flavors, a milky, malty underlay, and a fairly sound mouthfeel. Ample tannins and resiny, peppery afternotes re-announce any previously detected oak, and like many wines from this vintage it's overly expressive.",85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Maipú,Michael Schachner,2005,4.0,Reserva,Luigi Bosca
Argentina,"Reserved on the nose, with a hint of rhubarb and bramble. But where this wine really fails to impress is on the palate. It's sharp and underdeveloped, with tart cherry aromas and piercing acidity. Some mocha and vanilla come on late to help things along, but by then the wine has defined itself as borderline sour and miserly. Unusually short on fruit for Luigi Bosca, a winery we've come to like. Imported by Multiple U.S. Importers.",83,21.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Reserva,Luigi Bosca
Argentina,"This wine is much better than most in its class. The blackberry, graham cracker and exotic spice notes are particular to Bosca, while additional notes of bacon, chocolate and nutmeg add to the pleasure. For anyone looking for quintessential Argentine Malbec at a good price, we say start here.",91,18.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2005,8.0,Reserva,Luigi Bosca
Argentina,"Opens with funky, earthy aromas of juniper, herbs, green pepper and baked berry fruits. It's thick and grabby in the mouth, with roasted, herbal plum and berry flavors. Leathery and slightly burnt tasting on the finish.",84,21.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Reserva,Luigi Bosca
Argentina,"Damp earthy berry aromas are a touch murky. This feels bulky, grabby and tannic, while overriding flavors of coffee, toast and bitter chocolate make fruit a bit player. A choppy finish with hard tannins and herbal berry flavors puts this Cabernet in the midtier category.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Valle de Uco,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Reserva,Viñalba
Argentina,"Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Valle de Uco,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Reserva,Viñalba
Argentina,"This is a ripe Malbec with aromas of pipe tobacco, raisin and blackberry. The palate is rich and saturated, but a bit raisiny. Borderline overripe flavors of blackberry and cassis come with savory notes, while this is jammy, heavy and tastes of mint, spice and chocolate on the finish. Drink through 2021.",89,25.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Gran Reserva,Viñalba
Argentina,"Slightly baked and raisiny on the nose, with char and licorice aromas backing that up. The palate is more acidic than you'd expect, with an outsized zesty bite to go with snappy, herbal plum and cherry tomato flavors. Baked and warm on the finish.",85,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"A wide, jammy nose is the greeting on this fleshy, full-bodied Cab. Additional aromas of rubber, latex and smoke give it weight and masculinity. This runs spicy and lightly herbal in terms of flavors, while wood spice, cinnamon and herbs compete with mocha and chocolaty black-fruit notes on the finish.",88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Rooty, earthy berry aromas include a hint of clove. This feels full and chewy, with broad shoulders and firm tannins. Herbal blackberry flavors come with tea and spice notes. It is stocky and woody on a finish that tastes like campfire smoke.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,4.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Wiry, rugged aromas of cassis and blackberry are a bit green and pyrazinic. Chunky, tannic and sticky in feel, this tastes of baked black fruits. Stewy, syrupy and creamy on the finish, the wine gets better the longer it sits.",85,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Dark and leathery up front, with a dusting of nutmeg and sawdust. Feels a bit grabby and resiny, but it's boasting enough acidity to push things through. Flavors of cassis, berry and herbs are normal and nice, while the finish is warm and chunky. Good Cabernet for the price.",88,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.",88,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Strapping currant and berry aromas come with a full dosage of toasty oak. This Malbec feels sinewy, with good depth. Oaky notes of toast and blackened spice lend a chocolaty essence to berry and plum flavors, while this finishes with an herbal, spicy aftertaste.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"While this is stout and dark up front, the nose comes with a note of stewed fruit. The thick, tannic palate is grabby and resiny in feel, while flavors of raw oak taste lactic, and the berry fruit component in the wine is loamy and feels big and blocky.",86,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Gritty, muddled dark-fruit aromas come with burnt overtones. This has a hard, grinding palate along with roasted blackberry and raisin flavors. A minty character and hard tannins drive the finish.",85,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"A little damp and earthy at first, but it rounds into a full, powerful Malbec with a lot of color, size and drive. Blackberry, chocolate and spice notes control the hefty palate, and coffee precedes a bitter dryness on the finish. An improvement over the past couple of vintages. Drink now through 2012.",90,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Jammy aromas of raspberry and cherry show a slightly pickled, brambly edge, while the palate delivers tight, grabby cherry and berry flavors. There's a bit of cheesy tang to the finish, while sheering acidity and an overall light body make it food friendly.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Black fruit aromas feature a touch of licorice. Feels lively and alert, with edgy acids and juicy, forward flavors of plum and wild berry. Toasty, integrated and spicy on the finish, with pinches of green and black pepper.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Blackberry, oak, spice and chocolate aromas are dealt in equal parts. This feels ripe and fairly plush. Flavors of burnt toast, black pepper and charred wood lead secondary fruit notes across the palate and onto the finish.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,8.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"This is oaky and resiny on the nose, but not overly so, with pear and apple aromas as well as a streak of saline. On the palate, this offers a good mix of oak resin, fruit pulp and acidity. Flavors of oak spice, white pepper, peach and apple finish fresh but with an oaky aftertaste.",88,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,2.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Sophisticated barrel aromas of butterscotch, dusty peach and apple cider are inviting, while the palate shows good intensity along with flavors of apple, pineapple, peach and vanilla. While this is toasty, well-oaked and modern in style, it avoids being heavy and flat. Still, drink now for optimum balance.",88,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,2.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Ripe and maybe a touch overdone and weighty on the nose. The palate is plump and melony feeling, with sweet pear and vanilla flavors. Creamy, easy and long on what amounts to an oaky finish.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,2.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Early aromas of sea shell and chalk dust transition first to apricot and mango and later to wood grain. This wine feels plump but dilute, with moderate intensity and depth. Flavors of tropical fruits, banana and dry oak evaporate on the finish into undefined mildness.",87,20.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2016,2.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Salinic and almost dilute on the nose, which belies the richer banana and vanilla flavors that control the flavor profile. In the mouth, the wine has good bounce and acidity, so it feels alright even when things turn creamy on the finish.",86,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,2.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Pungent, yeasty, almost sweaty notes of onion and garlic blend with oak-infused cider and citrus aromas. This is round, fresh and not too heavy on the palate, while its oaky, smoky barrel and baked-apple flavors end with overt woodiness and mounting bitterness.",87,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,2.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose. A mid-level palate holds nectarine, lychee and oily flavors that turn bitter on the finish.",85,17.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2015,37.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,Oily aromas of peanut and burnt match ride high on the nose of this plump and pulpy tropical-leaning white. Typical lychee and honeydew flavors are slightly bitter in front of a fleshy palate with moderate acidity.,87,17.0,Other,Argentina,Michael Schachner,2016,37.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Varietally correct aromas of white flowers, lychee and tropical fruits feed into a plump, creamy palate that's losing some of the steam it probably had when it was bottled. Melon, banana and lychee flavors finish on the heavy, creamy side. Drink immediately.",86,16.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2013,37.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"A consistent Torrontés, with tropical and exotic aromas of green melon, lychee and bath oil. It feels round despite sporting nice acids, while flavors of green apple, lychee, melon and cardamom work well in front of a long, sweet, pithy finish.",88,15.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2011,37.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Oily and tropical on the nose, with pungency and clarity. The palate is full, layered, plump and loaded with lychee, honeydew and green herb flavors. Provides good feel and just enough acidity to make for a long ending.",88,15.0,Other,Salta,Michael Schachner,2010,37.0,Reserva,Terrazas de Los Andes
Argentina,"Atypical on the nose, as air freshener, berry jelly and exotic but odd aromas take over. The palate seems superficial and wholly unusual, with floral blueberry flavors and then an angular, floral finish. Not terrible but doesn't seem much like Cabernet.",84,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,4.0,Reserva,Argento
Argentina,"Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right.",87,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Reserva,Argento
Argentina,"An unusual specimen, especially on the nose, where spicecake, floral and incense aromas are atypical. The palate is kind of sharp and immature, with grapey, blueberry flavors and coconut on the finish. A different breed of Malbec, but not what we'd call a slam-bang success.",84,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Reserva,Argento
Argentina,"Argento has found its calling with this wine, by far the best to date from this label. It's deep and pure, with raisin, blackberry, spice and vanilla on the nose. Super solid and lush, with layered flavors of jammy berry, coffee and chocolate.

Argentina,"Saline and oak aromas are dominant, with tropical fruit scents and apple also registering. This is medium in body, with cutting citric acidity. Flavors of briny oak, popcorn and banana finish salty.",86,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2014,2.0,Reserva,Argento
Argentina,"Pine needle, orange peel and vanilla aromas are scattershot but pure.

Argentina,"Almost citrusy aromas of candied berry are jammy and unconvincing. The mouth is narrow and pinched in feel, with herbal, wiry berry flavors that finish minty and hot.",83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,4.0,Reserva,Fat Gaucho
Argentina,"Leafy, spicy, dry berry aromas lead to a jacked up, edgy palate with hard, scraping tannins. Forced woodspice and raw plum flavors finish more spicy than fruity.",83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserva,Fat Gaucho
Argentina,"Bold, gritty, balsamic berry aromas are rubbery and saucy in nature. Edgy and grating on the palate, but also full of spunk, this tastes salty. Modest red-berry flavors finish oaky and rustic, with a lasting note of aged balsamic vinegar.",86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserva,Fat Gaucho
Argentina,Ocean water and green banana are the lead aromas on this mostly neutral white. A light body with modest structure houses lime and tangerine flavors. The finish is juicy in feel but turns bitter as it rolls out.,84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,37.0,Reserva,Fat Gaucho
Argentina,"Rooty, spicy aromas of cola and herbal plum are slightly smoky and leafy. This is fleshy and open on the palate, with spicy, herbal flavors of tomato, tea and black plum. A similar herbal, meaty quality lasts onto the finish.",87,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,4.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"What herbal berry aromas this wine has evaporate fast, replaced by oaky clove and other spice notes. Iron tight and tannic, the wine draws on the cheeks. Spiced-up plum flavors set up a rugged finish with hard tannins and spicy berry residuals. Serve with beef or BBQ; it needs it.",88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2015,4.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Black currant and plum aromas come with a defined streak of minty green. The palate, meanwhile, feels boxed in by tannic grip.

Argentina,"Compact on the bouquet, with a pointed combo of boysenberry and blackberry aromas. The palate is full, with plenty of acidity and stuffing. Flavors of blackberry, olive, fig and chocolate are likable and the finish is loud and powerful in typical South American style. Better value than the higher-priced Kinien Cab. Drink now through 2012.",89,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,4.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Earthy, spicy aromas of juniper, bell pepper and oak cover up slightly underripe berry scents. This has an acceptable level of tannic scratch and peppery, herbal berry fruit flavors.

Argentina,"Mossy and inky in smell, this has a firm palate. Flavors of berry, herb and chocolate set up a dry finish, with structure and background complexities. Spicy and herbal, it has a Chilean sort of character.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,4.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Smells sort of furry and earthy initially, with notes of graphite and woodspice. Feels narrow and grabby, with pointed acididty framing red plum, cherry and lightly oaky, minty flavors. Fits the definition of good but regular Malbec.",86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,8.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Compact, gritty, stalky aromas are hard and herbal. This feels narrow and short on body, while flavors of generic berry fruits are a bit green and low on richness and depth. Oaky vanilla notes drive the finish.",87,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Smoky, gritty black cherry and blackberry aromas are herbal and smell a bit like road tar. This is flush on the palate at first, then more tight and tannic. Flavors mostly reflect the nose, meaning this tastes gritty, peppery, toasted and herbal, with spicy berry flavors rolling out over the finish.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,8.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Jammy, roasted aromas are more savory and offbeat than common and fruity. This Malbec has a fresh but choppy mouthfeel and flavors of tomato, basil and herbal berry fruits. A savory finish conforms with the rest of the wine.",85,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2015,8.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Meaty, dense and rich aromas, with driving scents of prune, licorice, blackberry and cola. The palate is healthy and rich, and it keeps in step with flavors of blackberry, dark plum and savory spice.

A lusty Malbec to drink now.",89,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,8.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"A more than solid wine cut from the tropical, South American blueprint. It's open and full of banana, pear and apple aromas, and while it runs hot and fast on the palate, it's got lots of woody, ripe flavors of apple and pithy citrus. Round, lively and packed with flavor even if it shows almost nothing in common with cool-climate Chardonnay.",88,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,2.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Argentina,"Dry spicy aromas accent woodsy berry scents. A tight focused palate jabs with acidity and poking tannins, while this tastes of lightly herbal cherry and berry fruit. Spicy flavors on a healthy finish help this along.",90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,43.0,Reserva,Ruca Malen
Spain,"Cool, earthy aromas of blackberry, vanilla and tobacco are encouraging. This aged Cab from the base of the Pyrenees is a monster with wall-to-wall tannins.

This is big and boisterous.",88,23.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Reserva,Enate
Spain,"Mulchy aromas lack fruit and freshness. In the mouth, this shrieks of high acidity and hard tannins.

Spain,Compost aromas and a clunky feeling palate get this off on the wrong foot. Flavors of burnt berry fruit and sweetness fail to impress. This shows hardly any snap on a cloying finish.,82,14.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,Michael Schachner,2013,4.0,Rosado,Enate
Spain,"This blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon opens with dry, earthy, spicy aromas of tomato, red plum and horse hide. It's racy and lifted on the palate, with good balance.

Argentina,"Chocolate and charcoal aromas form a dark and masculine greeting. There's also coffee and an herbal note to the nose.

Argentina,"High-toned, raw aromas of cherry and currant are backed by toasty oak and mint. Lively and lifted as well as choppy in feel, this tastes mostly of char, plum and peppery spice.

Argentina,"Opens with lovely blackberry and herb aromas that suggest richness and ripeness but not overt weight.

A thorough and balanced blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Syrah.",91,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,3.0,Reserva,Sottano
Argentina,"Gritty, burnt, stalky aromas are shy on fruit and not that fresh. This is tight and rough in feel, with peppery, herbal flavors that run green and low on fruit. More oak and modest berry flavors carry the finish.",83,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,4.0,Reserva,Kaiken
Argentina,"Jammy, brambly aromas of grassy blueberry and balsamic vinegar make for a rough entry. This feels chunky, grabby and hard, while flavors of lactic oak and herbal blueberry are strained.

Argentina,"Brushy aromas of wild herbs along with cherry and plum scents feed into a fresh, fairly full palate. This is generously oaked for basic Malbec, and thus spice and resin notes share the stage with plum and blackberry flavors. A dry, spicy, resiny finish is the close.",87,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Reserva,Kaiken
Argentina,"Heavily oaked up front, this smells of sweet spices, lactic berry fruits and hickory. The palate is fairly blocky and grabby, with resiny wood notes.

Argentina,"Harsh, grassy, weedy berry aromas mix with a heavy amount of clove. In the mouth, this is screechy and way off balance. A clove-heavy flavor profile is oaky and messy on Kaiken's entry-level Malbec.",81,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2016,8.0,Reserva,Kaiken
Argentina,"While the nose is toasted, raw and spicy, the palate is weighty and legit, with grabby tannins and generic but solid flavors of mixed berries, herbal notes and oak.

Argentina,"Dense, meaty and lightly herbal on the nose, with minty berry notes. The palate is firm and issues tannic crack in front of plum, herbal flavors, brown sugar and vanilla. Turns mildly hot and grating on the finish, with juicy length. Good for everyday Malbec.",87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserva,Santa Julia
Argentina,Lightly herbal berry and plum aromas are uncomplicated. A medium-full palate tastes of generic berry fruits and plum. Rubbery tannins make for a tight drawing finish.,87,13.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2016,8.0,Reserva,Santa Julia
Argentina,"Cherry and currant aromas come with soupy notes and a blast of animal fur. Although this is aggressive and choppy on the palate, it's loaded with grapy, slightly stewed berry and plum flavors. A similar tasting finish turns more rough and warm with airing.",87,13.0,Mendoza Province,Valle de Uco,Michael Schachner,2015,8.0,Reserva,Santa Julia
Argentina,"Modest peach and apple aromas rise up on a quiet nose. Active acidity adds punch to a fairly standard palate that conveys stone fruits, tangy citrus and salt. A mildly briny finish runs heavy on malic acid.",86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Michael Schachner,2016,2.0,Reserva,Santa Julia

Argentina,"Wayward, funky aromas of wet dog and candied fruits don't provide much elegance to the bouquet. This also feels somewhat bland and dilute, which is unusual for Argentina.

Argentina,"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust.

Feels and tastes a touch resiny on the finish, more evidence of the wine's barrel influence.",88,29.0,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Reserva,Altocedro
Argentina,"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup.

Argentina,"Altocedro's 2011 stable of high-end Malbecs all carry something in common: heavy, creamy oak that gives the wines severe milk chocolate and vanilla characteristics.

Carob, vanilla and cocoa flavors control a syrupy finish.",87,65.0,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Gran Reserva,Altocedro

Berry fruit flavors are herbal and the slightest bit green, with a black-pepper note in front of a rubbery finish with clamping tannins.",88,22.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,22.0,Crianza,Finca La Emperatriz
Spain,"Aromas of tobacco, wood grain, plum and cherry set up a plucky, lively palate with hard tannins. Spicy plum and berry flavors finish steady and drawing. Drunk now through 2023.",90,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2011,22.0,Reserva,Eduardo Garrido García
Spain,"Hot, stalky aromas of red chili flake and weedy raspberry lead to a lean, tomatoey palate with flavors of tomato, dried berry, vanilla and especially dill weed. A saucy, woody finish confirms that this is now mostly oak and acid; drink through 2020.",87,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,22.0,Reserva,Eduardo Garrido García
Spain,"Aromas of graham cracker, vanilla and berry fruits are inviting but lack depth. In the mouth, this is grabby, with abrasive but tolerable tannins. Flavors of oaky, toasty berry fruits are chocolaty and finish with hints of tobacco and vanilla along with more tannic bite. Drink 2018–2030.",90,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,22.0,Reserva,Eduardo Garrido García
Spain,"Earthy, ripe cherry and berry aromas come with notes of baking spices and tobacco. This is crisp in feel, albeit a touch jagged.

Spain,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are a touch briny. This is lively in the mouth, with lasting acidity that offers kick to an aged Rioja. Spicy notes of pepper sit on top of base-level cherry and plum fruit, while toast and spice flavors along with lasting acidity drive the finish.",90,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2004,22.0,Gran Reserva,Eduardo Garrido García
Spain,"Opens somewhat clipped and choppy, with citrusy aromas mixed with red fruits. The palate is healthy, lean and acidic, with bright plum and berry flavors softened by some creamy vanilla. A solid wine with punch, acidity and a good finish.",86,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,22.0,Reserva,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"This smells a bit charred at first, then turns syrupy and richly oaked. It feels fresh but hard, with spiky acidity that pushes the citrusy, vanilla-accented red-fruit. It finishes crisp and a little tart, with cherry, plum and herb flavors.",87,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,22.0,Reserva,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"Dark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging. The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.",88,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2004,10.0,Reserva,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"Initially, this may smell a bit hot and leafy, but with time that quality settles. It feels narrow, tannic and condensed, with roasted flavors of red berry, spice and chocolate. The finish offers a mix of citrus, red berry and herb flavors.",86,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Crianza,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"Smoky, toasty and dark on the nose, this value-priced Rioja delivers plenty for the money. On the palate, it is smooth and ripe, with integrated tannins and proper acidity. Flavors of earth, loamy berry, plum and vanilla are supple and medium in intensity.",89,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,10.0,Crianza,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",88,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,10.0,Crianza,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"Earthy plum and stalky berry aromas are bolstered by bold oak aromas. This feels good and healthy, with spicy oaky flavors that are dry lactic and push the wine's fruit to the background. A woody spicy, minty finish ends this. Drink through 2017.",87,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2012,10.0,Crianza,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"Forceful oak creates aromas of creosote, shoe polish, raw wood grain and leathery berry. This is high in acid, and hence rather sharp. Tart, snappy plum and pie cherry flavors finish fresh and tangy, but angular.",85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2013,10.0,Crianza,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over. This is a complete, stylish Rioja that's about halfway through the aging process. It's still juicy and agile, with licorice and raisin notes adding some sweetness. Drink now–2016.",90,38.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,1999,10.0,Gran Reserva,Ramón Bilbao
Spain,"Aromas of pencil lead, rubber and spice accent distant red fruit notes. The palate is none too deep, with dilution and bracing acidity. Tastes perky and lightly leafy, with cherry, raspberry, dry spice and finally buttery oak. Whispy but hollow for an '06 reserva.",86,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,22.0,Reserva,Castillo Clavijo
Spain,"Warm and earthy at first, but more soupy as it opens. Crisp, snappy red-fruit flavors are also on the herbal side. Nervy yet it does show a reasonable amount of honest Rioja quality. Still, for a 2001 reserva it doesn't amount to much.",84,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2001,22.0,Reserva,Castillo Clavijo
Spain,"Opens with earth, lemon peel and lightly baked plum aromas. Feels easy and plump, with a good mouthfeel and proper acidity. Shows creamy oak flavors along with rooty berry, toast and milk chocolate. Turns more spicy and dusty on the finish.",87,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,10.0,Reserva,Castillo Clavijo
Spain,"Smells a bit cheesy and leathery, with mint and slightly chemical berry aromas. Chewy in feel, with buttery flavors of red berry and chocolate. Tastes oaky, minty and forced, but overall it's not a bad wine given the price and subpar vintage.",84,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Crianza,Castillo Clavijo
Spain,"Rusty to the eye, then dry, spicy and elegant on the nose in a traditional manner. Focused and crisp in the mouth, with juicy currant and cherry flavors sweetened by cocoa.

Spain,"Leafy and peppery on the nose, with light red-fruit aromas and some citrus peel. It runs more lean and spicy than anything, with hints of tomato leaf, fennel and sausage.",86,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,1998,22.0,Gran Reserva,Castillo Clavijo
Spain,"Rusty in color and lacking fruit aromas on the nose, this is just good enough for a gran reserva. Leathery, roasted-plum flavors taste more like black olive than bright fruit. It's tannic and a bit dull on the finish.",87,22.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2008,22.0,Gran Reserva,Castillo Clavijo

Spain,"Riojas of this quality and price are not a dime a dozen. This ripe, delicious wine shows all the virtues of a great vintage. Earthy, roasted berry aromas are pure, ripe and magnetic. This feels full, tannic and strapping, while flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate are supported by generous but appropriate oak. Mocha, espresso and black-fruit residuals grace a fine finish. Drink through 2022.",92,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,22.0,Reserva,Marqués de Cáceres

Drink now.",89,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Reserva,Marqués de Cáceres
Spain,"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.",86,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,22.0,Crianza,Marqués de Cáceres

Spain,"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.",87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2007,22.0,Crianza,Marqués de Cáceres
Spain,"Plum and cherry aromas are riper than might be expected for a cool-vintage 2013 crianza. Chewy, drawing tannins lend grip to the palate that tastes of black plum, tea and dry spices. A bit of oaky chocolate is present on the finish.",89,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2013,3.0,Crianza,Marqués de Cáceres
Spain,"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2004,10.0,Crianza,Marqués de Cáceres
Spain,"Might this be the best wine Marqués de Cáceres has produced? The vintage is one of Spain's greatest, and gran reserva is supposed to be Rioja in its loftiest form.

Best from 2012–2018.",92,35.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2001,22.0,Gran Reserva,Marqués de Cáceres

Drink through 2020.",90,35.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,22.0,Reserva,Rioja Vega
Spain,"Charred and burnt-smelling, and those aromas are overpowering although not necessarily bad. Feels big and tannic, with bite to go with dark flavors of bitter coffee, roasted black plum and wild berry. The charred, burnt character that controls the bouquet returns with a fury on the finish.",86,38.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,22.0,Reserva,Rioja Vega
Spain,"Widely available Rioja Crianzas don't come much better than this. An opening of raspberry and strawberry aromas backed by direct cherry, raspberry and red-plum flavors render this all about fruit and freshness.",90,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2012,22.0,Crianza,Rioja Vega
Spain,"Solabal captures the essence of Rioja reserva with this fairly oaked, fruity wine. The palate is tight and demanding, with proper acid-to-tannin balance.

Drink now and over the next two years.",91,28.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2004,22.0,Reserva,Solabal
Spain,"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors.

Spain,"Raisin and earth aromas come across a bit baked and bland. Conversely, the palate is choppy and hard, with pointed acidity.

Spain,"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas. The palate feels fine, but the flavors are leathery and sort of salty, with touches of pepper and herbs as well. Not as ripe and appealing as what we're looking for from a Rioja reserva.",84,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2003,22.0,Reserva,Baron De Ley
Spain,"The high quality of the 2010 harvest is on display here. Enchanting aromas of mocha, toast and black fruits are complex and crafty. This feels fresh, with a hint of tannic scratch. Flavors of spiced cherry, currant and mocha finish with tobacco notes. Given that 100,000 cases of this Reserva were made, the end result is impressive. Drink through 2020.",91,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,22.0,Reserva,Baron De Ley
Spain,"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",84,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2002,10.0,Reserva,Baron De Ley
Spain,"Gritty stalky aromas suggest that the original material for this Gran Reserva was not fully ripe. This feels wide chunky and grabby, with harsh tannins.

Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",90,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,22.0,Reserva,Beronia

Spain,"Crisp, toasty oak and spice aromas are currently outranking this wine's berry-fruit components...but only for now. In five or more years, this will be less oaky and more complex. At this point in time, look for a sinewy, tight, almost jagged palate with toasty, robust flavors of plum and berry, dry spices and mixed herbs along with firm tannins. A long, balanced finish bodes well for the future. Drink through 2030.",93,27.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,10.0,Reserva,Sierra Cantabria
Spain,"The nose on this reserva is roasted and meaty, with dark berry accents. The palate delivers a flush feel and volume along with flavors of roasted plum, herbal raspberry and salt.

Spain,"Sierra Cantabria's wines are usually so good that one that's simple, tasty and regular such as this might get overlooked.

Finishes peppery, with full tannins and oak-driven mocha flavor.",87,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,22.0,Crianza,Sierra Cantabria

Spain,"Opens with funky aromas of sweaty leather and cheese that seem rustic for this bodega. Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades. Not the best Sierra Cantabria high-end wine I've tried but still shows excellence once it finds its stride. Drink from 2015–2025.",90,39.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,10.0,Gran Reserva,Sierra Cantabria

A spicy, lengthy finish is just right for Rioja gran reserva, and this still has time left on the clock, so drink now or hold through 2020.",91,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2004,22.0,Gran Reserva,Finca del Marquesado
Spain,"Mature, earthy and soft on the nose, with roasted, spicy, integrated berry aromas. Full but baked feeling, with maturity and monotone flavors of sweet berries that don't vary. It remains roasted and warm on the finish. Drink soon.",88,22.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2003,22.0,Gran Reserva,Finca del Marquesado
Spain,"Mature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness. It leaves you wanting more body and fruit.",86,49.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2001,22.0,Reserva,Resalte
Spain,"Raspberry and plum aromas include notes of asphalt, coconut, peanut butter and tobacco. This is fresh and layered, but hard as rocks.

Drink 2016–2024.",92,70.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2009,10.0,Reserva,Resalte
Spain,"Gritty on the nose, this has baked bean, mushroom, roasted plum and earth aromas. It feels blocky and tannic, with some cushion to the palate. Oaky tasting, with prune, vanilla and buttery notes that settle on baked fruit and chocolate. It comes on forceful and heavy and is arguably a little overripe.",89,80.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2005,10.0,Reserva,Resalte
Spain,"Savory oak, tobacco, vanilla and blackberry aromas create a nice opening. This feels tight and structured, with firm tannins. Flavors of savory oak, turned earth, blackberry and cassis end with smoky echoes of barrel spice and resin. Drink through 2022.",92,35.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2011,10.0,Crianza,Resalte
Spain,"Ripe, earthy aromas of cola, coconut, blackberry and cassis are healthy and heady. Reflecting a warm year, this wine feels both flush and fleshy, with mild tannins.

Drink through 2022.",92,35.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2010,10.0,Crianza,Resalte
Spain,"This is a bit mulchy and leathery on the nose, with stalky berry aromas. The heavy palate feels wide, with pointed acidity, bearing soupy flavors of vanilla and cream. It finishes with lots of flavor but a syrupy feel.",87,41.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2006,10.0,Crianza,Resalte
Spain,"Spiced berry, dry oak and a note of latex define the nose on this ripe, likable, friendly Tempranillo. The wine is lively on the palate, with candied, jumpy flavors of berry fruits that finish with some foxiness and a wet-fur note. The emphasis here is on fresh fruit more than power or oakiness.",89,32.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2011,10.0,Vendimia Seleccionada,Resalte
Spain,"Gritty, roasted aromas of herbal black fruits come up a touch short of fully ripe and convincing. This feels flush, with manageable tannins. Flavors of salty, roasted blackberry and dark plum continue to the tannic finish.",87,21.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2014,10.0,Vendimia Seleccionada,Resalte
Spain,"Supremely dense, with plum and berry jam, charred beef and molasses on the nose. The flavors go straight to blackberry, vanilla and chocolate, while the feel is full-bodied and probably a touch more tannic than desirable. Flush and even more tannic on the finish. Needs food and/or time in the cellar.",88,42.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2004,22.0,Reserva,Costaval
Spain,"Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended. Rugged but not out of whack, with meaty dark-fruit flavors and bitter espresso/pepper on the finish. Should come together nicely over the next two years.",91,26.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2005,22.0,Crianza,Costaval
Spain,"“Roble” means oak and there's no shortage of oak on this youngster. The nose smells almost like melted cheese and bread at first, but then it settles and lets out subtle leather and fruit aromas. The palate is juicy and fresh, with forward black cherry and plum flavors. Definitely lively, and with no tricks up its sleeve.",86,16.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2006,22.0,Roble,Costaval
Spain,"Typical for this winery, this smells a bit herbal, with tomato and earthy plum aromas leading the way. Scratchy, grabby tannins support savory, herbal berry flavors. Hard tannins struggle to resolve themselves on a firm, muscular finish.",90,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,22.0,Reserva,Marqués de Vargas
Spain,"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note.

Drink through 2022.",90,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2011,22.0,Crianza,Marqués de Vargas

Spain,"With a rusty color and leafy aromas of earthy berries and tar, this wine is fading. Hailing from a subpar vintage, it is acidic, with oaky resin on the mouthfeel. Flavors of herbal plum, tomato, vanilla and tobacco break up, while the finish brings stalky notes.",85,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2007,22.0,Reserva,Marqués de Riscal
Spain,"A good effort from 2003 (hottest vintage in ages) because it holds onto those classic Rioja qualities, like tobacco and spice on the nose as well as tea and black cherry flavors. It's definitely a bigger, rounder wine than in the past, but it will deliver the goods if drunk within the next few years.",88,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2003,22.0,Reserva,Marqués de Riscal
Spain,"This wine is the epitome of traditional Rioja Reserva. It opens with aromas of citrus peel, tobacco, earth, cherry, smoke and rubber.

Spain,"Earthy, leathery aromas of baked red fruits fit the classic style. This is full on the palate but not heavy, with cola, molasses, coffee and heady raspberry and plum flavors.

Spain,"Initial aromas of animal fur and cheesy oak give way to balsamic berry fruit scents. While this is mature on the palate, it's balanced and displaying vital acidic kick. Earthy plum and berry flavors finish with modest oak, spice and cocoa notes. This is ready to drink but not at the end of its road.",90,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,22.0,Reserva,Taron

Spain,"Despite heavy aromas of baked berry, prune and raisin, this is solid on the palate, with a firm grip. Flavors of earthy plum, tomato, red currant and herbs finish pure, tight and persistent.

Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",87,11.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,Michael Schachner,2004,10.0,Reserva,Viña Albali
Spain,"Dusty red-fruit aromas come with earthy, leathery tones. It feels tight, drawn and resiny, with hard spice and oak flavor. There's not much fruit to ponder, and the finish is dried out, with a woody note.",83,13.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,Michael Schachner,2007,10.0,Reserva,Viña Albali
Spain,"Dusty berry and cherry aromas include candied notes of cherry cough drop and marshmallow.

Spain,"A little burnt and chemical up front, and soon after the nose turns to lemon and shoe polish as the oak takes over. Flavors of raspberry, cherry skins and plums have a true but hollow flavor, and for the most part this wine wears its personality on its sleeve. Which means it's good, for Valdepeñas but there aren't any hidden nuances.",86,16.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,Michael Schachner,2001,10.0,Gran Reserva,Viña Albali

Spain,"For an off vintage, this is a nice wine. It has a touch of leafiness on the nose but also dark fruit, shoe polish and style. Gets better as it airs out, and thus the raspberry and plum flavors take on a forward, easygoing likability. Textured on the finish, and definitely not dilute or choppy like so many others from 2002.",88,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2002,22.0,Reserva,Luis Cañas

Drink now.",89,21.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,22.0,Reserva,Luis Cañas
Spain,"The excellence of the 2010 vintage is draped all over this studly Rioja. Earthy aromas of mixed berry fruits and forest floor feed into a saturated but well-balanced palate with firm tannins. Baked black cherry and cassis flavors meander towards a lightly toasted finish with mocha, chocolate and cassis notes. This is outright delicious more than stately or complex. Drink through 2024.",93,27.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,22.0,Reserva,Luis Cañas
Spain,"Stalky, roasted aromas lack freshness. This is scratchy and unbalanced on the tongue, with leathery black-fruit flavors that taste roasted and come with some burn. The finish is jagged and abrupt.",85,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2009,22.0,Crianza,Luis Cañas

Drink now.",85,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2007,22.0,Reserva,Viña Cerrada

Spain,"Solid, fragrant and as you'd expect, but also high-acid and nervy. Otherwise, this is a perfectly good quaffing Rioja; it's sort of sharp but food-friendly, with tangy cherry and raspberry flavors.

Spain,"Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce.

Spain,"This is a well-made Rioja with generic plum and berry aromas that come forth in fruity, bouncy fashion.

Spain,"Everything about this lighter-framed Navarran blend is an echo of when European red wines were racy and crisp as opposed to big, extracted, dark and woody.

Spain,"This is textbook Rioja gran reserva from a ripe, generous year. Aromas of cassis and prune blend with toasty, creamy oak.

Drink right away.",88,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2004,10.0,Reserva,Marqués de la Concordia

Spain,"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it.

Spain,"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar.

Spain,"From a region on the rise, this is nice Tempranillo, made in a lighter, food-friendly style. Which doesn't mean it's weak. On the contrary, the wine has good concentration and purity to go with fresh acids and an approachable texture. The flavors are of plum, cherry and licorice, while the finish is tight and comes in a couple of layers. Well made and easy to drink.",89,19.0,Northern Spain,Cigales,Michael Schachner,1998,10.0,Reserva,La Legua

Spain,"The aromas are a bit too prickly and pickled to call the nose clean, and thus the wine never really achieves solid footing. The raspberry and strawberry fruit is there, but it's marred by sharp, pickled accents, which ultimately don't work in its favor. The feel is nice, as the acidity and tannins are proper. But with too much funk to the nose and palate, it misses the upper echelon.",84,10.0,Northern Spain,Cigales,Michael Schachner,1999,10.0,Crianza,La Legua

Spain,"Jammy blueberry and prune aromas are ripe but a bit dull and rudimentary. Plump, chunky, jammy and tannic across the palate, this tastes like mashed blackberry and molasses.

Spain,"The bouquet of cherry and raspberry is sprightly and mildly leafy, with hints of leather and dried cheese.

Spain,"Sassy pepper and light rhubarb aromas give this medium-weight crianza a spicy, lean outlook.

Spain,"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up.

Spain,"More sharp and jumpy than many over-$20 wines from the region, but if you like a more racy, acidic style it may be up your alley.

Spain,"Don't dismiss this aged Toro because it smells cheesy and leathery, and don't give up on it when you're hit with massive tannins.

Spain,"An opaque color suggests power and density, and for the most part that's what you get. Jammy, raisiny aromas culminate with prune and berry pie scents.

Argentina,"Ripe, concentrated aromas of cassis and prune set up a rich palate with spicy black-fruit flavors. A loamy, meaty-tasting finish isn't complex but it is generous and jammy.

Argentina,"The nose on this choppy Cabernet deals red-fruit, tomato and pepperoni-like aromas.

US,"Bonterra sources organically grown grapes from both Mendocino and Lake counties to craft this light, slightly sour white generous in kiwi and a pronounced aroma and taste of honeydew.",86,14.0,California,Mendocino-Lake,Virginie Boone,2013,12.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,"Ripe fruit meets butter and spice in this medium-bodied, smooth and integrated wine. It opens with Bosc pear and golden apple aromas, melding with vanilla and marzipan notes, its richness of flavor nicely buoyed up by acidity.",90,14.0,California,Mendocino County,Jim Gordon,2015,2.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,"This wine is big and bold, but its opulent, generous fruit flavors perfectly fill out its frame, giving it the balance it needs for enjoyment. Ripe blackberry and black cherry notes mark the palate, unfettered by oak-inflected flavor. The texture is firm with lots of fine-grained tannins, while the fruit lingers nicely on the finish.",91,16.0,California,Mendocino County,Jim Gordon,2014,13.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,Beautiful black-cherry aromas and flavors make this wine direct and focused. A slightly gripping texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity keeps the mouthfeel lively. It has a wonderful sense of purity and focus.,91,16.0,California,Mendocino County,Jim Gordon,2015,13.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,"There's a faint hint of pink in the color of this bright, cheery, light and appetizing wine. It combines flashes of crisp green apple with ripe pear, golden cherry and white peach for a cornucopia of delicious fruit flavor.",88,14.0,California,Mendocino County,Jim Gordon,2013,25.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,"This is a deliciously easygoing Viognier bright with fresh apricot flavor, high in acidity and a finish of lemon-lime. Enjoy on its own or with spicy Thai or Vietnamese food.",87,14.0,California,Mendocino County,Virginie Boone,2012,25.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,"Substantive flavors and a rich, tannic texture form a serious profile for this deeply colored, dry and full-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries, tastes deep and concentrated, and has a very firm and nicely astringent mouthfeel. Pour it with a big steak, chop or roast.",91,16.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2013,4.0,Made with Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,"Aromas and flavors of fresh, crisp, green apples and golden cherries seem to light up this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It has firm acidity, a refreshing texture, and just enough heft in the body to serve with appetizers and cheese, but will also stand up to rich seafood preparations.",89,14.0,California,Mendocino County,Jim Gordon,2013,2.0,Made with Organic Grapes,Bonterra
US,"Lively aromas, an appetizing balance and just-rich-enough fruit flavors make a good combo in this medium- to full-bodied wine.

Spain,"Murky grassy berry aromas and a whiff of cinnamon make for a sketchy nose. This feels choppy, while quick-hitting flavors of forced oak, baking spice and murky berry fruits finish hollow.",83,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Michael Schachner,2015,4.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Mureda
Spain,"Light in color and just as light in body, this Merlot smells like cherry, plum and chewing gum. A lean linear palate generates tart generic red-fruit flavors prior to a sour finish.",82,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Michael Schachner,2015,17.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Mureda
Spain,"Citrus and apricot aromas are basic. This feels dilute but fresh. Peppery, slightly bitter and stalky white-fruit flavors finish similarly.",84,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Michael Schachner,2015,2.0,Made with Organic Grapes,Mureda
Australia,"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features aromas of pineapple and roasted cashew. Similar notes of ripe pineapple and nuts mark the palate, then ease to a rather soft, easy finish. Drink now.",86,18.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2016,2.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Yalumba
Australia,"This is a medium-bodied, richly textured Chardonnay that deserves a place on any table.

Drink now–2020.",90,17.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2015,2.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Yalumba
Australia,"Yalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner. It's full bodied and supple nearly to the point of creaminess, but delivers mixed berry, vanilla and baking-spice flavors, all with a certain amount of elegance. Drink now–2022.",90,18.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2015,24.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Yalumba
Australia,"On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly. Of course, that means nothing unless the wine is good. Thankfully, this wine is excellent. Apricot, honey and ginger notes mingle easily on the palate. Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017.",91,17.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2014,25.0,Made with Organic Grapes,Yalumba
Australia,"Not the darkest, biggest or richest Shiraz to ever come out of Australia, this is nevertheless a delightful wine. A green peppercorn note accents red raspberry and cherry fruit, with just a hint of vanilla in the background. Drink it over the next year or two.",89,16.0,South Australia,South Australia,Joe Czerwinski,2010,24.0,Made with Organic Grapes,Yalumba
Spain,"Heavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents. This feels tannic and tough, with up-front oak and herbal berry flavors. A dry tannic, spicy finish features palpable oak that tastes forced and like plastic.",84,11.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Michael Schachner,2015,10.0,Made With Organic Grapes,Venta Morales

France,"This pale rosé is showing its maturity at seven years of age, its fruitiness transforming into extra richness, with touches of toast. It's a very fine wine, ripe and ready to drink.",92,66.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2010,27.0,Brut Rosé,Deutz
France,"This most recent release of vintage rosé from Deutz boasts fine acidity and crisp young fruit, marking it as a wine to age. Bright and lively with a sophisticated edge of acidity and red currant fruit, it should be cellared until 2019.",92,66.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2012,27.0,Brut Rosé,Deutz
France,"It's a shame to release this wine so young, because its constituents are individually impressive. It will need a few years for the acidity to come together with the ripe melon and grapefruit flavors, the soft texture and the bright vivid character.",92,69.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2005,27.0,Brut,Deutz
France,"Any vintage Champagne from 2004 will still be young, and this is no exception. But with the fresh, light Deutz style, this is already offering delicious green plum and citrus flavors, supplemented by creamy acidity. The finish is soft, light, creamy.",90,69.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2004,27.0,Brut,Deutz
France,"This wine, though still young, reveals much about the Deutz style as well as the vintage. It strikes a balance between softness and crispness that fits the ethos of the house. At the same time, it's an attractive medium-term bottling, in line with what many producers acheived in 2010. It should be kept until 2019.",94,60.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2010,27.0,Brut,Deutz
France,"This is certainly rich, packed with youthful green- and white-fruit flavors, but it still has that seductive elegance that is the hallmark of Deutz. Here is a wine that definitely needs aging. It has richness but there is still a raw edge.",92,67.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2000,27.0,Brut,Deutz
France,"Potentially this is a delicious, fresh but firm Chardonnay in the more delicate Deutz style. Potentially, because this is still young. Wait a couple of years for the mineral and ultra-fresh apple flavors to blend together.",91,82.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2004,2.0,Blanc de Blancs Brut,Deutz
France,"This wine is still young, reveling in its bright fruit and mineral texture. Drawn from Côte des Blancs vineyards, it's tight, tense and loaded with citrus fruit. With its finely crisp aftertaste, it's delicious now for its fruit but will also be great from 2020, once its toasty character develops more fully.",93,80.0,Champagne,Champagne,Roger Voss,2010,27.0,Blanc de Blancs Brut,Deutz
Argentina,"Simple and easy to like, with cassis and cherry aromas along with a hint of earth, moss and leather. The palate is fresh, juicy and healthy, with clean, regular raspberry and ripe currant flavors. And the finish is long and mildly toasty. Good, presentable and ready to drink.",87,20.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2006,4.0,Grand Reserve,Graffigna
Argentina,"Earthy aromas suggest red cabbage and olive more than bright, ripe berry. The palate is chunky and clampy, with jammy, overly broad black fruit flavors that finish on the stewed and herbal side. Concentrated, massive and clumsy.",84,19.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2007,4.0,Grand Reserve,Graffigna
Argentina,"Every kind of pepper, from green to red to jalapeño, is present on the nose, along with red plum and spice aromas. Feels tight and zesty, with Italian-leaning flavors of tomato, oregano and basil along with cassis and strawberry. Crisp and agile on the finish, but tastes green.",84,20.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2008,4.0,Grand Reserve,Graffigna
Argentina,"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.",87,20.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2012,8.0,Grand Reserve,Graffigna
Argentina,"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.",90,20.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2006,8.0,Grand Reserve,Graffigna
Argentina,"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. On one hand, there's blackberry and cassis flavors to enjoy; on the other, the mouthfeel leaves you roughed up. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",84,20.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2004,8.0,Grand Reserve,Graffigna
Argentina,"Off the grid and strange smelling, with jumbled aromas that are hard to describe. Exceedingly sour and lean on the palate, with a vegetal finish.",80,20.0,Other,San Juan,Michael Schachner,2005,8.0,Grand Reserve,Graffigna
Argentina,"A light, mildly stemmy and roasted Pinot with medium body and a solid mouthfeel. While not all that aromatic, the wine tastes of strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, and there are accents of pepper and herbs along the way and on the finish. Shows good weight and color.",85,16.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,1.0,Selección,Alamos
Argentina,"Selección is proving itself to be a consistent modern Malbec (the last four vintages have rated 89 or 90 points). This rendition shows graphite, inky berry notes and savory spice aromas such as cumin and cardamom. It's rich and full bodied, with tobacco, coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. A smooth finish is neither tannic nor overpowering.",90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2011,8.0,Selección,Alamos
Argentina,"Saturated, inky Malbec with plenty of sweet mocha, chocolate and vanilla to go with black fruit aromas. The palate is big and bold but controlled, with compact, intense flavors of berry, leather and black tea. Smooth on the finish, with soft, integrated tannins and just enough acidity to maintain freshness. Drink this year.",90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2008,8.0,Selección,Alamos
Argentina,"This is Alamos's top Malbec, and it is fat and savory on the nose, with rubber, leather, asphalt and cured-meat aromas in addition to showing jammy fruit scents. In the mouth, this is lush and meaty, with blueberry, jerky and campfire flavors. A toasty, stout finish is big and weighty, but overall this fruit bomb is balanced.",90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,8.0,Selección,Alamos
Spain,"Ripe black-plum and spice aromas are dense and blocky. This is 85% Syrah and 15% Monastrell, with a jammy palate and a touch of heat and flab. Flavors of raisin, blackberry and prune finish earthy, with an echo of prune and moderately scratchy tannins.",89,22.0,Levante,Jumilla,Michael Schachner,2014,3.0,Selección,Monterebro
Spain,"This ruby colored Syrah-led blend is stout, oaky, minerally and convincing, with ripe cassis, prune and licorice aromas.

Spain,"Blackberry, cassis and dusty aromas get this full-bodied Syrah-Monastrell off to a great start. This is staunch and well built, with firm tannins and dark, masculine flavors of blackberry, black currant, pepper and a hint of salt. A gutsy finish is powerful but balanced. This is impressive for the price.",91,37.0,Levante,Jumilla,Michael Schachner,2011,6.0,Selección,Monterebro
Spain,"Dark purple in color, this Syrah-led blend with 15% Monastrell is jammy, toasty, herbal and minty green on the nose.

Spain,"This ripe wine from a warm year is raisiny up front, with additional scents of molasses and baked plum.

This is 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah.",89,18.0,Levante,Jumilla,Michael Schachner,2012,3.0,Crianza,Monterebro
Spain,"Crisp plum and floral aromas rest on rocky base and offer up balsamic notes. This Monastrell-driven blend is full in body, with spicy, herbal, wild-brush flavors accenting core dark plum and berry. A lasting finish is herbal, deep and potent. Drink through 2017.",90,15.0,Levante,Jumilla,Michael Schachner,2011,3.0,Crianza,Monterebro
Spain,"This wine's compact, lightly toasted berry aromas are reticent but also slyly complex. The palate is packed with firm, abrasive tannins. Dark berry, spice, toast and chocolate flavors finish long and harmonious, with equal amounts of herbal, exotic, oak and berry flavors. Drink through 2026.",92,42.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2012,10.0,Selección,Arrocal
Spain,"Loamy, ripe, earthy aromas of black cherry suggest raisin and stewed berry. The palate is full and mostly balanced for a warm-vintage, very ripe wine such as this. Flavors of berry, roasted plum and earth finish with raisiny richness and just enough zesty acidity to keep things upright and afloat. Drink through 2018.",90,42.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2009,10.0,Selección,Arrocal
Spain,"Elegant yet ripe on the nose, this gets going in fine form via spicy, exotic, oaky aromas on top of primary berry tones. Powerful and oaky on the palate, with a creamy vanilla flavor, this brings on the blackberry, mocha, cocoa and toast as it works its way to a clean, long finish. One can drink this now, but the optimum window will be 2018–2021.",93,38.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2010,10.0,Selección,Arrocal
Spain,"Dark, meaty aromas of blackberry, boysenberry, herbs and spice pave the way for a jammy, tannic palate that's jumbled in feel.

Spain,"Dense, roasted, earthy aromas of lightly stewed berry fruits and leather set up a deep, oaky palate with baked, loamy dark-fruit flavors that finish smooth, mellow and rich in feel. This is luxurious Mencía with modest acidity; drink through 2017.",91,45.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,Michael Schachner,2011,46.0,Selección,Godelia
Spain,"Ripe black-fruit aromas are cuddly and reflect the warm conditions of 2012. Tight and ribbed on the palate, this has the structure to handle blackberry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors without seeming overripe or jammy. A saturated finish benefits from the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2023.",93,40.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,Michael Schachner,2012,46.0,Selección,Godelia
Spain,"Briary, woody, scratchy aromas announce plenty of new oak, and there are also balsamic notes, leather and wild berry scents to ponder.

US,"Most of the fruit for this wine comes from this vineyard's 1975 plantings. It brings nuanced aromas of pear and mineral, drinking just a hair off dry, with more than ample acidity to balance out the fleshy flavors. The finish lasts a long time.",90,21.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,18.0,Celilo Vineyard,Ross Andrew

Meanwhile the cranberry and cherry flavors are sweet and concentrated, creating an uneasy juxtaposition.",87,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2010,6.0,Boushey Vineyard,Ross Andrew
US,"A blend of three new Syrah clones that were fermented separately, then blended into a satisfying, though still young and somewhat jagged wine that will benefit from more bottle age. It comes out toasty and gamy, with undertones of cured meat, stiff tannins and moist earth. The classic Boushey vineyard flavors of herb, green tea and cured meats are here in abundance.",91,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,6.0,Boushey Vineyard,Ross Andrew
US,"All aged in single-use French oak, this offers pleasing nuances of corn on the cob, spice, mineral and chamomile. The prickly pear flavors are both elegantly styled and well balanced.",89,45.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2013,2.0,Celilo Vineyard,Ashan

US,"Sourced from vines planted in 1982, it's brightly aromatic with sweet floral notes, orange peel and lychee. Medium bodied, it drinks dry with abundant spice and floral flavors. A thoroughly delicious wine that begs to be paired with scallops or spicy Thai dishes.",91,22.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,23.0,Celilo Vineyard,Dowsett Family
US,"The aromas explode with exuberant notes of lychee, rose water, pink grapefruit and spice. The palate is medium-bodied, drinking dry with a spicy and flowery finish. The balance is impeccable.",90,22.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,23.0,Celilo Vineyard,Dowsett Family
US,"The cool 2011 vintage hit the Columbia Gorge especially hard, but winemaker Chris Dowsett has crafted an expressive, wonderfully fragrant old-vine Gewürztraminer. This is tart and saline, with notes of lemon, lime and grapefruit rind and flesh that combine to form a delicate, lingering, snappy and bracing style.",90,22.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,23.0,Celilo Vineyard,Dowsett Family
US,"From vines planted in 1982, this delivers exuberant lychee, spice, rose petal and citrus zest aromas. It's dry and medium-bodied on the palate, with spice-driven flavors and floral notes that persist on the (slightly warm) finish. It drinks well on its own but really sings at the dinner table.",91,22.0,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2015,23.0,Celilo Vineyard,Dowsett Family
US,"These vines were planted in 1984; they are dry-farmed with all-natural acids, most unusual for Washington State. So you have a beguiling mix of aromatic, lightly soapy, perfumed, floral scents, matched to exotic passion fruit and grapefruity citrus. There is a lot of acid here, and it's a young wine, but it has wonderful concentration and a full-throttle mix of perfume, fruit and flesh. The finish seems endless, and promises a long life ahead.",92,22.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Paul Gregutt,2007,23.0,Celilo Vineyard,Dowsett Family
US,"The fruit shows pears, some high tones, some bitter rind. The style is fruit forward, with flavors of pears and citrus, leading to a light, toasty finish.",86,12.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,1999,18.0,Anna Maria,Valley View

US,"Cabernet Franc seems to be a strength in the Rogue Valley, as the fruit expression is good and the aggressive herbaceousness of Cabernet Sauvignon is somewhat tamed. Here the aromas are blackberry and cassis, and those fruit flavors are threaded with smoke and coffee. Balanced into a light, herbal finish.",86,28.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,19.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Half tank fermented, half barrel fermented, this full-bodied and spicy effort marries apple and banana fruit flavors to a dash of piney herb. It strikes a different chord than most Willamette Valley Chardonnays, but has the suppleness and body to match most poultry dishes.",88,22.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2014,2.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Lots of ripe apple and tropical fruits, lots of butterscotch and caramel flavors, but not too heavy. Good balance, good acids, a very appealing, forward style which isn't too oaky or heavy for food.",87,15.0,Oregon,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,2000,2.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Though the listed alcohol pushes well past 15%, this wine does not show that much heat or concentration. Aggressive oak-treatment flavors of vanilla and tobacco mingle with mint, cola and black cherry.",85,24.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,13.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"An intriguing wine with notes of dried apricot, lees and honeycomb. The throttle is pulled back in terms of feel while it still possesses a lot of richness to the fruit flavors and an impressively long finish.",88,18.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2012,25.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Soft and peachy, with good midpalate concentration. This is a simple but fruity and flavorful wine, with just the vaguest suggestion of Meyer lemon in the finish.",87,22.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2007,25.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"A somewhat unusual expression of Viognier with notes of lime, lime leaf, and white peach that seem more reminiscent of a Sauvignon Blanc. It's full bodied and viscous, ending with a bitter note.",86,16.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2011,25.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"This is a tight, sharp, pungent Viognier, with penetrating scents of lemon oil and pine. In the mouth it is grapefruity and slightly bitter, with a perception of almond skin as it fades away.",84,22.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,25.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Broad across the palate, this brings flavors of orange soda and orange candy, with a grainy impression. It's fruit forward, with a quick fade.",85,22.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,25.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"A sharply defined, racy Viognier, this cuts right through with a mix of pine needle, citrus rind and pineapple. It should be served chilled and would be a fine accompaniment to grilled prawns, spicy noodles or anything with jalapeños.",87,22.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,25.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Sweet, grapey fruit, plum and cherry, enhanced with peppery spice. The tannins are a bit ashy, but well integrated; with not too much oak. Overall, a balanced and elegant approach.",87,30.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,1999,6.0,Anna Maria,Valley View

US,"Not sure why a five-year-old Syrah is being released in the spring of 2009, but it remains reasonably fresh. The primary fruit is fading, and the excessive, toasty, smoky barrel flavors tend to bury the subtleties that age may have provided. This is simple, peppery, and absolutely ready to drink right now.",85,24.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2004,6.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"A definitive scent of leather suggests brettanomyces has taken over here. That leathery nose and palate totally dims the fruit, and dries out the finish.",84,24.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2012,6.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"The Tempranillo—bud wood from Abacela—was grafted onto 30-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines. Not sure how many vintages have been made, but it's too soon to rate the experiment. This is a lightly toasty, rather elegant red with little varietal character, but it's nicely built and perfectly fine for a simple supper.",85,26.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2006,10.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Light and chocolaty, this carries a strong and distinctive scent and flavor of cinnamon spice. On the palate, the flavors suggest strawberries, with a quick-to-fade finish.",85,24.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,10.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"Though the palate can't deliver all that the aromas have to offer, there's intrigue to this estate Tempranillo with notes of dark flowers, sweet tobacco, and dried tea leaves playing off olive and other savory notes.",86,18.0,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2010,10.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
US,"This is overtaken with unripe flavors of tomato and underbrush. There's little suggestion of fresh fruit. Aged 14 months in one-use French oak, it finishes quickly with earthy tannins.",85,18.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Paul Gregutt,2013,10.0,Anna Maria,Valley View
Spain,"Clean lines and fresh, oak-tinged aromas is what this Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is all about. The nose starts with lemon, green apple and a spot of vanilla, while the juicy palate brings bright white fruits, toasty oak and smoke. Not overly complex but not rudimentary or dull. A nice food wine and probably the best barrel-fermented white from Muga we've tried.",89,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2009,14.0,Barrel Fermented,Muga
Spain,"Stone-fruit and melon aromas are minerally. This feels linear and tight due to racy acidity. Flavors of white fruits, lime and stones are slightly tart, while this is short but firm on the finish. For barrel-fermented Viura, this is not oaky in any overt way.",89,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2015,14.0,Barrel Fermented,Muga
Spain,"Crystal-clear aromas of green apples and minerals come with a slight dash of oak. This is barrel-fermented Viura (with 10% Malvasia), but there's nothing woody or overtly barrel-dominated about the wine, which is tight and citric on the tongue, with tangerine, green apple and nectarine flavors that finish racy and tart.",89,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2013,14.0,Barrel Fermented,Muga
Spain,"This blend of 90% Viura and 10% Malvasia gives off scents of saline and pool water along with apple, citrus and green herb notes. The palate is zesty and high in acid, leaving a clipped feel and flavors of lime, pineapple and green apple. It's nicely built but modest in its overall expression.",86,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2011,14.0,Barrel Fermented,Muga
US,"Oak-driven aromas are strong on the nose, with buttered popcorn dominating. Full and rich, notes of cedar and toast pervade over a hint of green apple. A bit lazy on the palate, this oaked style is for those who enjoy rich and creamy Chardonnay.",85,23.0,Virginia,Virginia,Alexander Peartree,2013,2.0,Barrel Fermented,Veramar
US,"While the nose on this Chardonnay is decidedly savory, with notes of cooked apples and buttery cheese rinds, the palate is surprisingly feminine, with pretty orange-blossom and apple jelly notes. Opulent and fruity, yet refreshingly-balanced in alcohol and acidity.",85,21.0,Virginia,Shenandoah Valley,Anna Lee C. Iijima,2010,2.0,Barrel Fermented,Veramar
US,"This wine is nutty on the nose, with faint hints of lemon, vanilla and ghee. More fruit comes through on the palate, boasting lemon, apple and pineapple, with nuts and chamomile adding depth. This straight-forward and balanced wine has a long and harmonious finish.",87,25.0,Virginia,Virginia,Carrie Dykes,2015,2.0,Barrel Fermented,Veramar
US,"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.",91,68.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Matt Kettmann,2010,4.0,Family Reserve,Vincent Vineyards
US,"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.",91,68.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Matt Kettmann,2012,4.0,Family Reserve,Vincent Vineyards
US,"Blackberry, oregano, asphalt and black gravel show on the nose of this first vintage effort from a new property along Highway 154 in Los Olivos.

US,"Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District.

US,"Agreeable and smooth, this tastes pro-actively flavored with oak. The wood character comes out as flavors of maple syrup, vanilla and clove in addition to the plum and raspberry notes from the grapes. It's good, commercial-quality red wine.",83,8.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2012,4.0,Family Reserve,Oak Grove

US,"Here's a supple, velvet-textured Merlot from the all-around successful 2012 vintage in California. It pulls together baking-spice aromas and attractive, ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry on the medium-bodied palate. It conveys a sense of breadth and meatiness without being heavy.",85,8.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2012,17.0,Family Reserve,Oak Grove

US,"This inexpensive wine is enjoyable to drink for its raisin aromas, ample fruit flavors and comparatively soft, easy texture for the variety.",86,8.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2013,29.0,Family Reserve,Oak Grove
US,A relatively light and civilized version of a notoriously dark and full-bodied varietal. The color is a medium purple. An aroma of grilled vegetables leads to satisfying cherry flavors carried on a moderately tannic but not extreme texture.,85,8.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2012,29.0,Family Reserve,Oak Grove
US,"This well-oaked, smoky wine is a great value. It has abundant baking spice aromas, as well as rich flavors of ripe pear, nutmeg and vanilla. Ample acidity and delicate tannins help maintain balance.",87,9.0,California,California,Jim Gordon,2016,2.0,Family Reserve,Oak Grove

US,"It tastes lean and refreshing, with light lemon and green apple in the aroma and flavors, rather light body and a slightly tangy finish.

US,"The high alcohol (15.5%) and pruney character suggests that this was picked late—a bit too late to retain any elegance. The acids are sharp and citric and not well integrated, leaving the fruit almost invisible. Decanting opens it up a bit; this is an excellent vineyard, but it has not been all that well served here.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,17.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Merry Cellars
US,"Pure Merlot from a cool site in a cool vintage yields a somewhat attenuated wine with tart berry fruit. The barrel aging has contributed flavors of sandalwood and chocolate, but the chalky tannins need some rich red meat to soften them up.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,17.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Merry Cellars
US,"Pretty scents and flavors suggest raspberry jam and blueberry compote; then some rather scrapey acids and stiff tannins kick in. The excellent fruit is there to begin, but it quickly turns one dimensional and finishes tannic and stemmy.",86,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Merry Cellars
US,"This pure varietal wine showcases rich, ripe cherry pie fruit backed up against a mineral-soaked base. Baking spice highlights and a streak of caramel reflect aging in 100% new French oak. Acids and tannins are proportionate and substantial.",93,50.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2012,4.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Côtes de Ciel

US,"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron.

US,"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead in this wine, followed by Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Franc (15%). The aromas are all high toned, including spice, dried dark fruit and herb notes.

US,"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors.

US,"Lovely delineation here, the berry/cherry fruit framed with coffee and chocolate from a 50/50 mix of French and American oak barrels. The surprise is the addition (via co-fermentation) of 6% Viognier, which stabilizes color and gives a pleasing, floral/citrus lift to the scents and flavors. Good balance and follow through.",91,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2007,6.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,:Nota Bene
US,"This is pure Syrah from Ciel du Cheval, and is head and shoulders above the winery's Columbia Valley bottling.

US,"Tart and astringent, this young wine shows good structure but remains a bit tight. Light red fruits, a streak of citrus, and a strong base of cement and chalk-like minerality, this has persistence and complexity. It needs more cellar time to fully express itself.",88,35.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Paul Gregutt,2008,6.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,:Nota Bene
US,"For the first time these excellent grapes are being shown in a single-vineyard cuvée. It's a big, tannic, high-octane wine, with smooth, ripe and generous purple fruits. There is plenty of supporting acid, along with rather astringent tannins that carry a leafy note through the finish. Drink now–2019.",91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,:Nota Bene
US,"A vineyard change in 2008 moves the source of the grapes north from Red Mountain to the Royal Slope. Young vines yield rather tight, bare flavors, with sweet grain and vanilla components contributed by the oak barrel (just one barrel was produced).",86,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,44.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,:Nota Bene
US,"Conner Lee is one of a small number of Washington vineyards that merits vineyard-designated Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine lacks nothing, and the fruit is firm, sculpted, and varietally correct, with a touch of ripeness around flavors of plum and cherry. Enjoy it young, or cellar it for another five years.",90,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,4.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,:Nota Bene
US,"Only in Washington can you find pure varietal, single-vineyard Merlot at this price that shows such power and depth. Aged in American oak barrels with French oak stave inserts, it displays plenty of smoky caramel and coconut flavors, but the fruit is there in good proportion. This wine is sure to find plenty of admirers; if only more than just 58 cases had been produced.",90,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,17.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,:Nota Bene

It's a quaffer with cojones.",88,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,17.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,:Nota Bene
US,"If the label is to be believed, this pure Merlot, from a relatively cool site in a relatively cool year, tops 16% alcohol. The flavors reflect that; a thick mix of tar, smoke, asphalt, espresso and coffee grounds. Buried in there is some black cherry fruit, but it is definitely the barrel flavors and the alcohol that dominate.",88,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,17.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,:Nota Bene
US,"Aged for 22 months in 20% new French oak, this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot completes a trio of excellent Conner Lee-designates from :Nota Bene in 2009.

US,"Aged for 22 months in French oak—one third new—this is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot. Nota Bene's wines are not shy about high alcohol, but here the fruit stands up well to the oak treatment and shows no sign of over-ripeness. A good spine supports a rich wine with black fruits, balanced acids, and a big streak of espresso.",91,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,5.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,:Nota Bene

US,"Still youthful and showing a fair amount of barrel in the nose, this unfined and unfiltered single-vineyard Chardonnay will benefit from another few years of cellaring. Fresh apple and peach flavors anchor a solid mid palate.",90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,àMaurice

US,"If there is a better vineyard than Boushey in Washington for Syrah, it has not yet been discovered. This young wine tastes like younger vines, with more green and less meat in the flavors. But the complexity and depth of Boushey fruit is there, and the wine takes you on a ride through a mélange of intriguing herb, fruit, cured meat and barrel flavors.",92,55.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2008,6.0,Boushey Vineyard,JM Cellars
US,"Pure Syrah from the Boushey Vineyard, this was barrel aged in a mix of half new Russian and French oak. Citrusy acids brighten up this wine, where the tight-wound, tangy red fruit flavors suggest wild, just-picked raspberries. With excellent concentration and focus, this is a wine to cellar for up to a decade.",92,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Paul Gregutt,2010,6.0,Boushey Vineyard,JM Cellars
US,"Brooding blackberry, dark plum, dried herb, vanilla and bacon fat aromas are followed by sappy, rich, saturated fruit flavors in this wine. It's a hedonistic rendition of Syrah that holds nothing back.",92,48.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sean P. Sullivan,2014,6.0,Boushey Vineyard,JM Cellars

US,"From the rocky Stagecoach Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cabernet is hearty in tannins and built to age through 2020, the dense black berry and cherry fruit flavors needing time to mature.

US,"There's a heaviness to this 76% Cab blended with 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc and 5% Malbec.

US,"This is the winery's estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, and it opens rather stiff and herbal. It's a taut, dark and deep wine that rewards decanting, showing good concentration and dense layers of brambly berries, licorice and espresso. Age for at least another decade.",90,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,4.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

US,"Complex and precise, this lovely Cabernet—blended with 10% Merlot and 3% Malbec—layers cassis, herb, bark, earth and graphite elements within a cigar box coating.

US,"Spicy red currant fruit comes up quickly, backed with the grape's signature accents of stem and earth. There's a residual flavor of slightly bitter tomato leaf.",88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,8.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"Vanilla, cocoa, barrel spice and herb aromas are followed by creamy fruit and barrel flavors. The vanilla notes overwhelm the nose and palate, however, distracting from the fruit.",88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,8.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"Bright acidity accompanies tight, wild berry fruits. As with many Malbecs, the fruit is balanced against clean earth and stem, with a touch of tomato leaf in the aromas.",89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,8.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

US,"The oak—a mixture of new and used French and American—takes the lead on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, cocoa and coffee out in front of plum and dark fruit. There's a pleasing mixture of richness and lightness. The variety gets a bit subsumed but there's still much to enjoy.",90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,8.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

US,"The vineyard-designated wines from Novelty Hill consistently reflect the site in terms of a deep-seated earthy, herbal character. It's quite like a modern Bordeaux, taking the cassis fruit as a base and cloaking it with toasted flavors from earth and barrel.",90,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,17.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

Sullivan,2012,16.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

US,"This has a little bit of Cabernet Sauvignon (5%) and Merlot (2%), winemaker Mike Januik say it's there “to beef up the structure.” The Sangiovese brings the acid, and tart fruits with a hint of leaf and tomato. Still young vines, but showing great promise.",88,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2007,16.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand.",91,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,12.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

US,"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc. Here is the same mix of racy, bracing tropical and stone fruit flavors, nicely matched to toasty flavors of almonds and biscuits. Elegant, detailed and ripe, yet clearly varietal, this is a beautiful, seductive example of barrel-fermented Washington Sauvignon Blanc.",92,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,12.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

US,"A strong whiff of new French oak hits the nostrils when this is first opened, but with some airing it develops into an excellent, deeply concentrated Chardonnay. Apple, pear, melon and papaya flavors are all in play, with enough natural acidity to keep the wine lively and fresh.

US,"I can see why so many of Washington's winemakers love this young vineyard. It is already expressing the sort of subtleties that most viticulturalists would kill for. The fruit is ripe but not too sweet or jammy. It is annotated with citrus, leaf and stem, along with streaks of smoke and herb and mineral. It's all mixed together seamlessly and focused into a firm, almost muscular style with real authority.",91,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2004,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

US,"The Stillwater Creek vineyard bottling of Novelty Hill Syrah shows a bit more concentration than its sibling in 2011, with whiffs of pepper, earth, soy and umami. There's a saline character as well, reflective of the mineral-rich soil, and a pleasant taste of toast in the tannins.",88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2011,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill

Sullivan,2014,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"Novelty Hill's vineyard-designated Syrah is bigger, darker and more aromatically complex than the companion Columbia Valley bottling. Cassis and blackberry fruit flavors are layered with chocolate and spice; immaculately clean, this does not display the earthy/meaty aspect of Syrah, but does have a pleasing minerality at the core.",89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"This tight, young Syrah has a succinct core of blueberry and raspberry flavors, which are wrapped in a mix of herb, earth and green tea.

US,"The estate Syrah immediately shows a toastier nose and richer fruit than the excellent Columbia Valley bottling. Along with cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit are powerful layers of toasted nuts, butterscotch and coffee. At the moment the wine seems still to be holding something back; decanting and substantial breathing time are highly recommended.",92,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,6.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"The oak (50% new French) plays a big part in this show, with aromas of coffee and pencil lead alongside the variety's strawberries and herbs. It's supple and pillowy in feel with a high yum factor.",91,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,26.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"Berry, vanilla, coconut and barrel spice aromas are followed by barrel flavors in this wine. It brings appeal, but the oak (42% new French and American) seems to take over.",88,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2014,26.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Novelty Hill
US,"Aromas of green wood, vanilla and cola are followed by plump fruit flavors. The palate brings appeal but the aromas don't seem to match up.",87,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2012,17.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Helix by Reininger
US,"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years.",92,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,17.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Helix by Reininger

US,"Well-aged and drinking at a peak, this 100% Sangiovese is round and toasty, filled with plush cherry fruit, and just a smidgen of green olive. The barrel aging brings in accents of toasted walnuts through a full, inviting finish.",90,29.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2008,16.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Helix by Reininger
US,"This wine brings aromas of toast, dried herbs, dark raspberries and cranberries. It's silky in texture, with the concentration a bit wanting. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but it still provides enjoyment.",87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2010,16.0,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,Helix by Reininger
US,"This limited-production Viognier reflects the ripeness of the 2012 vintage. Immediately appealing, it coats the tongue with thick, peachy/tropical fruit flavors. A hint of saline cracker comes through as well.

France,"This well-balanced wine is poised easily between ripe red fruits and some light tannins. It has great spice, attractive perfumed acidity and great style. Touches of pineapple give a more tropical character to the aftertaste.",89,23.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,Roger Voss,2015,9.0,Premium,Château Roubine
France,"The main estate wine from Roubine is a rich, ripe and fruity with a light edge of spice. It has a soft character, the result of the malolactic fermentation reducing the acidity. That gives a great balance between the red fruits and tangy zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",90,23.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,Roger Voss,2016,9.0,Premium,Château Roubine

Finishes short but sturdy, with balance and good acidity.",87,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,9.0,Rosado,El Coto
Spain,"The first act of dried spices and light, dusty red fruit aromas is honest and subdued. The palate brings good weight and lightly leafy, tomatoey accents to red cherry and raspberry flavors. Light, dry and a little stemmy on the finish. Standard but hinting at elegant.",86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2007,10.0,Crianza,El Coto
Spain,"Stalky berry aromas lack overt ripeness and pop. This feels pushed to the center, with minimal mouthfeel. Stalky, lightly burnt and leathery berry flavors finish hot and dried out.",84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2012,10.0,Crianza,El Coto
Spain,"Reddish in color and big on the bouquet, with sweet berry and cherry aromas. The palate is full and fun, with acidity and heavier, sweeter flavors of strawberry, raspberry and sweet plum. Handles its size well. Made from 80% Garnacha and 20% Graciano (for acidity).",86,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2010,9.0,Rosado,Ilurce
Spain,"Reddish in color, with raspberry and other high-toned aromas. The palate is fleshy but clean, with good acidity pushing slightly sweet cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes with sugar and a good mouthfeel. Gets the job done.",85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2008,9.0,Rosado,Ilurce

Spain,"Red in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together. The palate is acidic and tight, with tangy watermelon and peach flavors carrying the cleansing finish. Juicy to the extreme, but a good partner for food.",84,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,Michael Schachner,2007,9.0,Rosado,Coto de Hayas
Spain,"Spice, leather and oak aromas rest on top of an earthy base that doesn't suggest any particular fruit. This Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels narrow and choppy. Flavors of savory oak, baked berries and chocolate finish dry and drawing.",86,11.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,Michael Schachner,2013,3.0,Crianza,Coto de Hayas
Spain,"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors.

Spain,"There's nothing wrong with this value-priced blend of Grenache, Tempranillo, Syrah and Cabernet. Yes, it's probably on the generic side of the fence; but given that the berry and cherry flavors are forward, clean and bright, one shouldn't complain. Snappy, with just a hint of coconut and mocha on the finish.",86,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,Michael Schachner,2006,3.0,Tinto,Coto de Hayas
Spain,"Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",83,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2007,10.0,Rosado,Darien
Spain,"A wide-open, jumbled rosé without much focus or charm. There's peppery heat on the nose and then a lemony, citrusy palate that's at first soda-like and later kind of flat. Has acceptable intentions, but seems to be fading.",82,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,10.0,Rosado,Darien
Spain,"Hard and tough to penetrate on the nose. The palate is crisp and a bit raw in feel, with narrow, dry plum and berry flavors. Finishes with buttery tasting oak and a crisp, acidic fade-away.",84,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2007,22.0,Crianza,Darien
Spain,"Despite some spearmint and Band-Aid on the nose, this ready-to-drink wine shows good quality from head to toe.

Hints of tomato and citrus fruits also get into play.",88,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2005,10.0,Crianza,Darien
Spain,"Salmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle.",83,14.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Michael Schachner,2010,32.0,Rosado,Ochoa
Spain,"Whereas once Ochoa produced some of Navarra's best rosés, lately the wines have been marginal. This is awkward, with aromas of chemicals and rubber gloves. The palate is wan in flavor and feel, while the finish tastes burnt and medicinal.",83,14.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Michael Schachner,2012,32.0,Rosado,Ochoa
Spain,"Chunky smelling, with herb, tomato and roasted plum aromas. Acidity is the first impression in the mouth, followed by roasted flavors and herbal/tomato accents. A standard Navarra Tempranillo that's acidic and veers towards red and herbal.",84,20.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Michael Schachner,2006,10.0,Crianza,Ochoa
Spain,"This smells nice and rooty, and also a bit like strawberry jam. It feels steely, zesty, juicy and almost too acidic, with blazing red plum and pie cherry flavors that are offset by integrated, spicy oak. It's dry and tangy on the finish.",86,24.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Crianza,Ochoa
Spain,"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity.

France,"A very rich wine, spicy and complex. Dark fruits, rich tannins and layers of berries, exuding power and density. There is a sense of fine tannin as well, suspended in the texture of the wine.

France,"A big, ripe, still very young wine with black fruits that are right up front. It's jammy and juicy, with almost as much fruit as tannin. There is some aging potential, with the underlying dryness of the structure, but the wine is mostly about ripe fruitiness.

France,"The Chambert estate was first planted in 1690. Now owned by Philippe Lejeune, it is farmed biodynamically.

Spain,Open-grained oak aromas dominate a toasty nose with heat. This feels lean and tomatoey. Flavors of tart plum and pie cherry are almost sour and feel edgy due to severe wood tannins.,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2014,22.0,Crianza,Palacio del Burgo
Spain,"Charred, earthy black-fruit aromas are smoky and power-packed. This feels full yet balanced, with freshness and strong tannins. Ripe berry, prune and oak-spice flavors finish with a note of vanilla and length.

Spain,"Mint and jammy plum and raspberry aromas are a touch spicy. This is astringent in feel, with dry, oaky red-berry and tomato flavors. An angular, tart finish fades quickly.",83,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2014,22.0,Tinto,Palacio del Burgo
Spain,"Rooty aromas of cola nut, baked berry fruits and blackberry jam set up a plush, jammy palate of solid tannic framework. Baked berry, dark plum and loamy notes end with meaty, roasted flavors that are typical of a well-made wine from Jumilla. This is 60% Monastrell, 25% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.",90,16.0,Levante,Jumilla,Michael Schachner,2010,3.0,Crianza,Casa de la Ermita
Spain,"Floral berry and plum aromas are lightly woody. This feels full and edgy, with fairly hard tannins. Black-fruit flavors are certainly ripe, while this finishes bold and intense, with scratchy tannins. The blend is Monastrell, Tempranillo and Cab Sauvignon.",88,15.0,Levante,Jumilla,Michael Schachner,2013,3.0,Crianza,Casa de la Ermita
Spain,"This is interesting from the opening. Floral aromas include violet, bath soap and lavender along with blueberry. This is tight on the palate, with exotic flavors of blackberry and licorice that turn darker and grittier with airing. Cassis and exotic spice notes push the finish.",87,13.0,Levante,Jumilla,Michael Schachner,2013,3.0,Roble,Casa de la Ermita
Spain,"Aromas of Middle Eastern spices, pencil eraser, oak grain, red plum and cherry make for a complete nose. This Tempranillo offers good body and a fair amount of oak on the palate along with spicy plum fruit that tastes more oaky and lactic on the finish.",87,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2013,10.0,Crianza,Raiza
Spain,"On first take, the bouquet is hampered by reduced aromas of iodine and the palate feels hard, tight and racy. With airing, this shows better. Flavors of blackberry and plum come to life and finish well, and as a whole, this is good in a pedestrian, regular way.",86,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2009,10.0,Crianza,Raiza
Spain,"At first this is lactic and heavy, but later it becomes charred and toasty. Its feel is full, round and fairly smooth, with baked plum, berry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and solid. Good for a 50,000-case production.",86,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Crianza,Raiza
Spain,"Stewy yet flush, with shearing acids, this has a meaty, leafy aroma that sets up the angular palate. Flavors of stewed berry, spiced tomato and burnt leaves turn slightly bitter on what amounts to a short finish.",83,15.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,Michael Schachner,2009,10.0,Crianza,Gladium
Spain,"Meaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.",83,15.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,Michael Schachner,2005,10.0,Crianza,Gladium
Spain,"Big, dark and bold, with smoky aromas of bacon and blackberry. The palate is firm and tannic, with wild berry flavors and weight that transitions into herbs, spice and licorice on the finish. A big wine that rounds together well.",88,11.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Crianza,Gladium
Spain,"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.",88,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2006,10.0,Crianza,Vaza
Spain,"This is roasted, savory and spicy up front, with solid berry aromas. It feels crisp and fresh, with a blend of cherry, strawberry and herb flavors. It's spicy, lively, fresh and clean on the finish.",87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Crianza,Vaza
Spain,"Clean, fresh aromas of plum, raspberry and cherry give this wine a red-fruited personality. The mouthfeel supplies grip and mild tannic clamp, while flavors of plum and berry come with a touch of resiny oak. This crianza is textured and solid on the finish, but still fresh. Drink now through 2017.",88,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2009,10.0,Crianza,Vaza
Spain,"Earth, leather, herb and berry aromas set up a firm palate and gripping structure. The midpalate is focused on red fruit and light oak tones, while the finish is crisp, fresh and zesty.",87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2011,10.0,Crianza,Vaza
Spain,"Savory, spicy, herbal berry aromas lead to a sinewy palate that's full of acidity and chop. Oaky plum flavors are woody and a bit muddled, while this wine tastes of oaky red fruits on a fiery finish.",87,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2014,10.0,Crianza,Valdelacierva
Spain,"Cherry, plum, vanilla and mild oak aromas feed into a medium-bodied, elegant palate with plum and cherry flavors supported by a touch of toasty oak and vanilla. Notes of café mocha and toast grace a crisp finish that isn't trying too hard.",90,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Michael Schachner,2012,10.0,Crianza,Valdelacierva
Spain,"Floral red-fruit aromas fold in herb and spice accents. This is a crisp, dry Rioja with plenty of oak character on the palate.

Spain,"Only 400 cases of this top-level crianza were made, and it smells rich and good, with notes of ripe berry and plum and a mild syrupy note. Although it feels big, it's also fresh and layered, with pure berry, herb, spice and oak flavors. Toasty, smooth and elegant as a whole. Drink now–2015.",91,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2008,10.0,Crianza,Vecordia
Spain,"Aromas of rubber band, smoky berry and plum come with herbal, rustic overtones. This feels grabby and tannic, while punchy acidity releases angular black-fruit flavors. A roasted, meaty tasting finish brings the heat and feels aggressive.",85,15.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2011,10.0,Roble,Vecordia
Spain,"A generous example of young Ribera. Dark mint, cola and blackberry aromas get more herbal with airing. The palate is secure and tannic, with ripe blackberry and sweet Bing cherry flavors. Chocolaty and tannic on the finish.",88,16.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2009,10.0,Roble,Vecordia
Spain,"Full, lusty and slightly floral smelling, with notes of leather, crusty berry and hoisin sauce. Feels thick, with body and weight along with flavors of berry, cookie dough and floral hints. Long, meaty and slightly herbal on the finish, with just enough complexity to nudge it ahead. Drink now through 2015.",90,34.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2009,10.0,Crianza,Convento Oreja
Spain,"Lightly herbal aromas and a touch of animal blend with oak-based notes of sweet plastic and vanilla on the nose. The palate is round but slightly flabby, with moderate acidity. Lactic oak creates a plastic-like flavor that is derivative of the nose, while the finish is drab.",85,23.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2012,22.0,Roble,Convento Oreja
Spain,"Grapy wild blackberry aromas and then a tough, tannic palate tell you most of what you need to know about this hard-knuckled specimen. Flavors of grape skins, plum and blackened spice finish bitter and peppery.",84,23.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2014,22.0,Roble,Convento Oreja
Spain,"Jumpy and nervy smelling, with tottering aromas of jammy berry and strawberry. It feels dilute at first, but more structure and body appear as the wine unfolds. The flavor of jammy raspberry is somewhat herbal, and the finish is light.",84,23.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Michael Schachner,2010,10.0,Roble,Convento Oreja
Spain,"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",85,25.0,Northern Spain,Toro,Michael Schachner,2008,40.0,Crianza,Damalisco
Spain,"Initially this smells horsey and a bit green, but with airing it improves. In the mouth, hard tannins and aggressiveness rule the show. Flavors of baked, meaty, toasty berry fruits finish smoky, chocolaty and savory, with a pinch of green herbs.",88,20.0,Northern Spain,Toro,Michael Schachner,2009,40.0,Crianza,Damalisco
Spain,"Spicy oak aromas accent foxy red berry scents in this pinchy, wayward wine. Its chocolatey black fruit and peppery spice flavors finish jammy, with a lot of unresolved oak.",88,15.0,Northern Spain,Toro,Michael Schachner,2014,40.0,Roble,Damalisco
Spain,"Stalky, leathery, roasted aromas are muddled. This is acidic on the palate, with a gritty mouthfeel. Flavors of stalky, herbal berry fruits lack purity, while the finish is hollow and bitter tasting.",82,15.0,Northern Spain,Toro,Michael Schachner,2012,40.0,Roble,Damalisco
Argentina,"A mixture of coconut, cedar and marzipan scents along with gritty, briary black-fruit aromas precedes a lively palate with weight, power and balance. Flavors of berry, plum and cassis are bold, oaky and chocolaty, while the finish hits hard with mocha, caramel and vanilla notes offset by bright acidity. Drink through 2018.",91,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2010,3.0,Gran Reserva,Septima
Argentina,"This comes out swinging, with bullish berry and prune aromas that hint at being stewy but then pull back. It's saturated and tannic but not rough, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and pepper flavors. Minty and dark, with a licorice note on the finish. Drink now–2016.",92,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2009,3.0,Gran Reserva,Septima
Argentina,"Initially, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat smells murky, leathery and nutty, but with airing it settles and cleans up. Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.",89,35.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2012,3.0,Gran Reserva,Septima
Argentina,"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.",91,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2007,3.0,Gran Reserva,Septima
Argentina,"Earthy, roasted blackberry, leather and animal aromas are draped all over this Malbec blend. A palate with drawing tannins and firm acidity frames flavors of baked black fruits, toasty oak and char.

Drink through 2021.",90,35.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,2013,3.0,Gran Reserva,Septima
US,"This single-vineyard 100% Cabernet Franc is firm, juicy and focused. It has a phenolic bite at the back end, along with lemony acids. The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years.",90,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,19.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,Arbor Crest
US,"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years.",90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2006,2.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,Arbor Crest
US,"This is a hot, ripe, extracted style that will be quite appealing to many consumers. However, the volatile high-toned scents and the hot edge from the excess alcohol make it a tough match for food.",85,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,1999,2.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,Arbor Crest
US,"At first high-toned, this opens nicely with crisp green apple fruit flavors. It's balanced and clear. Don't look for big, blowsy tropical flavors or buttery oak, though the barrel fermentation provides some texture to the finish. A great food wine.",87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2005,2.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,Arbor Crest
US,"Fermented in neutral Burgundian oak, this is crisp and stylish, and brings in tart Asian pear, jicama and white peach. Flavors are clean and razor sharp. No alterations, additions, or finings are employed—this is as noninterventionist as it gets.",92,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2009,2.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,Buty
US,"This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch.",88,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sean P. Sullivan,2015,2.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,Buty

US,"This is one of the stars of the vintage in 2010; the Conner Lee fruit is rich and fully ripe, with a pleasingly candied aspect. Yet it remains lively with bracing acids, citrus and apple, and highlights of toasted nuts and caramel. A big, grin-inducing wine that is virtually irresistible.",93,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Paul Gregutt,2010,2.0,Conner Lee Vineyard,Buty

France,"Using fruit sourced from old vines, this firm, tannic and concentrated wine has a fine balance between the dense texture and bright black-plum and berry flavors.

Drink from 2017.",91,25.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Roger Voss,2012,8.0,Cuvée Prestige,Château du Port
France,"Dry, firmly tannic wine, dominated by mint and coffee flavors along with wood. The fruit underneath has a suggestion of ripe blackberry flavors but will need at least 3 years to come out.

France,"This wine comes from the highest terrace above the Lot River, giving it a cool, fresh feel. Gravel and chalk soil give both lightness and minerality.

France,"From a 16-acre vineyard, this 100% Malbec wine is properly dark in color, with dense tannins as well as ripe black plum fruits. There is a strong mineral character from the chalk in the soil, giving a powerful texture as well as structure that will allow the wine to age. This rich wine should be drunk from 2020.",92,25.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Roger Voss,2014,8.0,Cuvée Prestige,Château de Cénac

It finishes mild, with some oaky residue.",87,8.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,Michael Schachner,2010,46.0,Roble,La Mano
Spain,"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet.

Spain,"This is dark as night, with boysenberry, blackberry, animal fur and smooth oak aromas.
